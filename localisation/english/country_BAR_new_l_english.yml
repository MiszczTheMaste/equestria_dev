  #TODO: check descriptions below for errors and if they make any sense
  #rewrite if needed
  BAR_friend_state_of_our_home_desc:0 "Chaos reigns supreme in Barrad as the cultists, like ravenous predators, lay waste to lands forgotten by gods. Those who hold any sort of power and influence exploit the turmoil for their own gains. Yet, amidst this tempest of strife, the four unlikely friends plan how to make things right."
  BAR_friend_join_gasienica_desc:0 "As his master teeters on the brink of death, Gąsienica employs every resource at his disposal to uphold the dominion of Ambrosius. Despite a turbulent history marked by fleeting hostilities, aligning forces with him could prove to be a prudent course of action. After all in the intricate dance of power and intrigue, he navigated the delicate balance between loyalty and survival for many years."
  BAR_friend_enemies_within_desc:0 "Ambrosius meticulously crafted a fragile power structure that enabled his secession from Wittenland. With him gone, the entire thing crumbled. To endure and thrive, we must reclaim our dominion over the realm."
  BAR_friend_ultimatum_to_influential_desc:0 "Ambrosius did not have an iron grip on the entire Barrad. Numerous formidable individuals seek to exploit the current chaos, and it becomes imperative for us to assert our dominance and remind them of the true authority."
  BAR_friend_train_local_militias_desc:0 "Ambrosius may not have been benevolent toward his subjects, but Gąsienica sees potential utility in arming them. The notion of empowerment, albeit in the midst of chaos, could play a crucial role in reclaiming control over the tumultuous realm."
  BAR_friend_griffon_friends_desc:0 "In times of need you can count on your friends, and Gąsienica has many friends among his fellow griffons. Yet, the looming question remains - will they accept his recently forged alliances?"
  BAR_friend_welcome_defectors_desc:0 "It seems that some of those who sought to exploit our current situation possess more intelligence that what their previous actions suggested. They've opted to align with our cause, and while a welcome is due, precautions must be taken to secure their unwavering loyalty."
  BAR_friend_operation_tempest_desc:0 "Time is running short. We must assemble our allies and embark on an armed campaign against every last potential threat against our rule in Barrad."
  BAR_friend_operation_lomnica_desc:0 "Banditry a persistent scourge of Barrad, requires an unwavering response. Collaborating with our recent allies among the common ponies, we shall embark on a sweeping operation across the countryside, ensuring the eradication of this menace once and for all.."
  BAR_friend_prepare_reactor_ignition_desc:0 "Amidst all challenges, we must persist in pursuing our objectives. The potential power from the reactor could hold the key to resolving the problems we confront. Yet, with each step forward, doubts linger and multiply..."
  BAR_friend_ignite_reactor_desc:0 "Our path forward is unobstructed, and we shall proceed with our plans towards reactor. If the gods harbor any concern for us mere mortals, may their watchful eyes be upon us.."
  BAR_friend_meet_ambrosius_desc:0 "The Mad Count has awoken from what seemed to be an eternal slumber, but he changed. No more do his halls resound with maniacal laughter and hedonistic revelry, instead his voice now beared the tones of reason. And he seeks an audience."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_desc:0 "Merely fending off cultist assaults and raids is a futile endeavor. We must seize the initiative and confront them on their own territory, maintaining relentless pressure."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_mountains_desc:0 "Within our mountains lies countless underground structures, whether formed naturally, excavated by diamond dogs, or shaped by other forces. If these depths harbor cultists, we must either subdue them or entomb all within beneath layers of unyielding rock.."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_elysium_desc:0 "Elysium the largest city in Barrad, harbors a subtle cultist enclave. While not overtly violent, this cell engages in covert acts of sabotage and other clandestine activities that elude our knowledge. It demands our decisive intervention."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_roughers_desc:0 "The eastern forests are great for two purposes, concealing and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Barrad. Both we and the cultists are well aware of this, emphasizing the need to thwart their covert operations."
  BAR_friend_occupy_grand_sanctuary_desc:0 "The grand sanctuary evokes the most unsettling feelings. The last encounter Pentarchy and Gąsienica had within its sacred halls involved a battle to liberate Ambrosius. Yet, upon departing, a lingering sense that something crucial had been overlooked has persisted to this very day. Now, they are compelled to rectify it..."
  BAR_friend_enemies_without_desc:0 "We find ourselves inadequately equipped for the impending conflict, yet it will come, whether we desire it or not. Perhaps launching an offensive against our adversaries before they amass greater power than us is the best option we have."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_desc:0 "It is beyond doubt that our southern neighbor will inevitably launch an assault. Observing the rapid expansion of their industrial might, it would be wiser to engage in conflict sooner rather than later."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_bonus_desc:0 "We must press forward, in the face of potential defeat, the cost becomes inconsequential."
  BAR_friend_convert_factories_desc:0 "Our resources are primarily tailored for internal conflicts. We must maximize their utility to the fullest extent possible for the incoming war."
  BAR_friend_seize_factories_desc:0 "Barrad harbors weapon manufacturers, predominantly catering to the black market in other nations. To stand any chance against external threats, we must seize control of their enterprises."
  BAR_friend_employ_mercenaries_desc:0 "Despite Gąsienica's disdain for mercenaries, numerous groups operate in our region, and undoubtedly those recruits will prove useful."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_desc:0 "Austurland's intentions remain uncertain, but Gąsienica believes that abandoning them would leave our flank vulnerable in the event of a potential conflict with the River Federation. It appears we must take a gamble..."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_bonus_desc:0 "Our current predicament has turned us into cornered animals, and so we must embrace that essence. With all of its ferocity."
  BAR_friend_fortify_border_desc:0 "Having secured our southern border, the imperative now lies in fortifying the western frontier to dissuade any potential invasions. May it allow us to focus our efforts on any potential threat from Riverlands."
  BAR_friend_light_of_the_star_desc:0 "In recent weeks, a cascade of unforeseen events unfolded. In his mastery of the unpredictable, Ambrosius seized the opportunity to introduce yet another layer of the unexpected. For better or worse, it is to be seen."
  BAR_friend_prince_of_wittenland_desc:0 "Much to his surprise, the ponies of Barrad responded positively upon learning that Silver Star had assumed leadership of the county. Perhaps they harbor hopes of a reunion with Wittenland, or maybe their trust is placed in the belief that he would govern akin to his sister."
  BAR_friend_letter_to_sister_desc:0 "Silver Star summoned the necessary courage to start writing a letter to his sister, a gesture that piqued the curiosity of certain deer."
  BAR_friend_fight_for_friendship_desc:0 "Even in the darkest recesses of his nightmares, Silver Star never envisioned the prospect of losing someone dear to him. Until now, he hadn't deemed anyone worthy of risking his life for. Yet, an unfamiliar power surges through his veins, filling him with determination to fight for the sake of his friends"
  BAR_friend_move_to_wittenburgh_desc:0 "Even with the Wittenland crown secured, our Riverland neighbors understandably still harbor suspicions about us. Perhaps relocating to Wittenburgh could dispell the notion of us being mere invaders and fostering trust."
  BAR_friend_serving_justice_desc:0 "Silver Star has learned how forgive for many transgressions, yet sororicide stands resolute outside the bounds of pardon. Unfortunately for those in Wittenland, he has also acquired the art of confronting challenges and not evading the responsibility"
  BAR_friend_homecoming_desc:0 "Victory is ours; the interlopers have been expelled from Wittenland. Now is the moment to unfurl the banner of three crowns across the lands."
  BAR_friend_river_federation_membership_desc:0 "Our circumstances are curious, for Wittenland long stood as a member of the River Federation. With our newfound rule, does this entitle us to membership as well? We must find out."
  BAR_friend_viira_and_silver_diplomacy_desc:0 "Silver Star found himself ill-prepared for the multifaceted challenges of governance, with diplomacy proving to be a particularly formidable adversary. Fortunately, no obstacle exists that cannot be overcome with the support of a friend."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff_desc:0 "Even united both Wittenland and Barrad lacked the economic prowess observed in the nations to the far west. Perhaps we could ask for some assistance?"
  BAR_friend_evi_griffons_diplomacy_desc:0 "Despite the well-known tensions between Wittenland and the griffons in the west, and Silver Star's personal reservations towards them, it seems imperative to extend a symbolic gesture of friendship in an effort to thaw the icy relations."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff2_desc:0 "Neither Viira nor Silver Star possess extensive experience in the realm of business, but everypony has to begin somewhere as securing foreign investments could significantly benefit us."
  BAR_friend_diplomacy_getting_somebody_competent_desc:0 "Despite their earnest intentions and best efforts, the two friends found themselves empty-hoofed after their diplomatic endeavor. Fortunately, there are more seasoned individuals just waiting to be called upon for assistance."
  BAR_friend_riverlands_diplomacy_desc:0 "Ambrosius appeared genuinely surprised that it took Silver Star this long to seek his assistance. Though when he was his age, he likely preferred spending time with mares rather than a leader of a rogue state."
  BAR_friend_merchant_dynasty_desc:0 "Ambrosius' immense fortune was not meticulously built from scratch; he inherited it, just as his father did before him, and countless others in his lineage. Each sought to pass on more than they received, and Ambrosius emerged as perhaps the shrewdest among them all."
  BAR_friend_one_hoof_washes_the_other_desc:0 "To get something from somepony, you must present an enticing offer aligned with their desires. However, exercise caution not to overtly reveal your intentions, for that might prompt them to demand more. It's a rather straightforward principle, wouldn't you agree, my young friend?"
  BAR_friend_buy_our_stuff_desc:0 "Barrad harbors abundant untapped resources that could serve as a valuable asset. Our endeavor should focus on securing potential buyers to feed into our burgeoning industrial pursuits."
  BAR_friend_silver_tongue_desc:0 "Ambrosius possesses exceptional gifts, and among them, his extraordinary social skills stand out. There is no being in existence with whom he cannot initiate a conversation, delving deep until a profound acquaintance is established."
  BAR_friend_regional_interventionism_desc:0 "To everypony's surprise, White Star was not only willig to assist her brother in ruling after losing her crown but also exhibited enthusiasm for the role. Perhaps shedding the constraints of monarchy played a part, or she simply reveled in the return of her sibling. Regardless, she advised adopting a more proactive stance in regional diplomacy, acknowledging that blood had already been spilled."
  BAR_friend_conquer_steppe_desc:0 "Those steppe griffons are impervious to reason. We need a swift resolution to prevent any future raids into our lands."
  BAR_friend_aproach_cossacs_desc:0 "As the government shifts on the steppe, an opportunity arises to cultivate alliances and safeguard our heartland from potential raids."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_deal_desc:0 "Grifofns in Gryphus always were well wersed in buissness, they surely will understand importance of cooperation between our countries for our mutual security and potentialy proserity."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_not_for_long_desc:0 "Gryphus looms as a potantial threat, demanding our attention before it spirals beyond control. Surprisingly, there is a measure of support for this prospective invasion, particularly among Ambrosius' feathered friends from the southern moutains."
  BAR_friend_bandits_and_communists_desc:0 "Communist uprisings, erratic rulers, famine. By venturing into those lands, we extend a favor to the griffons. Simultaneously, we thwart a looming threat to our region."
  BAR_friend_lushi_ultimatum_desc:0 "The gateway to absolute peace in Evi Valley lies in the small nation of Lushi. A diplomatic approach to persuade them to join our cause is advisable. However, it must be made explicitly clear that rejecting our proposal will carry significant consequences."
  BAR_friend_bring_order_to_helquil_desc:0 "Our attention seldom graced that distant realm. Yet, as our sphere of influence extended to this place forsaken by spirits, intervention became imperative."
  BAR_friend_ruin_has_come_desc:0 "Ruin has come to Barrad. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed lands. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth as we were spreading the realm of death and madness! But it can be reclaimed from the ravenous clutching shadows, rebuild into new house, opulent and imperial."
  BAR_friend_now_what_desc:0 "The mantle of rulership rests uneasy on Silver Star's shoulders, a responsibility he never envisioned. Amidst the recent tumultuous events, he finds himself adrift and overwhelmed. Fortunately, steadfast friends stand ready to guide him through the uncharted waters."
  BAR_friend_2_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy's reign, strength dictated supremacy - a simplistic rule leading to inevitable chaos when the strongest vanished. It becomes imperative to forge new societal structure, one rooted in collaboration rather than fear."
  BAR_friend_3_desc:0 "Despite the turmoil, the inhabitants of Barrad share more common ground than they realize. With the alleviation of constant fear and strugge for basic resources, it becomes imperative for them to rekindle the sense of unity they have seemingly forgotten."
  BAR_friend_4_desc:0 "Collaboration holds its merit, but it was trust that steered Pentarchy away from its dark course. This invaluable lesson gradually permeates the understanding of the common ponies too."
  BAR_friend_5_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad diligently toil, liberated from oppressive rule, banditry, and cultist influence. They rebuild infrastructure, rejuvenate trade, and witness the resurgence of circulated goods."
  BAR_friend_6_desc:0 "When working together we can exchange not only what we need to survive but also ideas that comes to our mind. It seems live two sided sword considering that cooperation between pentarchs focused on building a reactor leaded to time of strive, but it also holds much potential for good."

  barrad_friends.997.t:0 "End of an Era"
  barrad_friends.997.d:0 "As Silver Star, Viira, Leopold, and Asinti embraced the spirit of Harmony, they decided to overthrow Count Ambrosius and his cruel minions. The mad Count refused to abdicate, and battle was joined. Ambrosius and his minions were no match for the combined power of the four friends, however, and they were quickly defeated. As the four became close friends, they fully realized the depths of their wrongdoing. They appeared before the commoners of Barrad and apologized for their actions, admitting that their aims were misguided.\n\nThe peasants, however, did not care. When they realized the four had let their guard down and were within reach, they immediately descended upon them to enact their vengeance for decades of horror, abuse and slavery. An angry mob of hundreds of ponies armed with pitchforks and torches swarmed the magocrats and slew them one by one before they even realized what was happening. Thus, the Pentarchy came to a violent and sudden end.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events is sure to signal the beginning of a new era for Barrad, although only time will tell if it is to be a happy one."
  barrad_friends.997.a:0 "So ends the Pentarchy."
  barrad_friends.1.t:0 "Library Use"
  barrad_friends.1.d:0 "Viira always left Silver uneasy: that calm, collected deer held a smile that strained his calm; her eyes, seemingly docile, that kept a secret beneath. Profoundly unsettled, trying to converse with Viira was akin to chatting with a ravenous wolf behind its toothy grin.\n\nHowever, this sensation had recently changed. Before, Silver would've searched a way out of a situation involving Viira. He now found himself oddly at peace as the two of them shared the main table at the library, each diving deep into their tomes. The unicorn hadn't even noticed Viira, and when he did, there was no reflexive recoil nor a shudder. Instead, as Viira looked up to meet his eyes, she smiled and greeted him with a "you're looking well."\n\nPerhaps, had Silver been anypony else, Viira might have seen him as a threat that required eliminating. Together, however, she merely treated him as a partner, an ally... a friend?\n\nSilver, with a faint smile, greeted back."
  barrad_friends.1.a:0 "You too, Viira."
  barrad_friends.2.t:0 "Mechanical Aid"
  barrad_friends.2.d:0 ""So, what have you been up to, Silver?"\n\nSilver nursed his glass of red wine with some hesitation. He kept eyeing Leopold's study for some hidden trap or weapon stash that the griffon would reach for were he to take a disliking to Silver suddenly.\n\nHe swallowed his hesitation. "What else? Worrying over the frailty of mortality."\n\nLeopold's mechanical eye whirred as he sipped his drink, making Silver tense up slightly. "Do you fear me?" Leopold asked unexpectedly.\n\n"I– yes," Silver replied with a start, somewhat surprised at his own candidness.\n\n"And why is that?" Leopold placed his glass on the table beside him. "I've never once made an attempt on your life, have I?" At Silver's silence, the griffon added, "I've only spoken about bettering people. I've mostly referred to enhancements in strength and durability, true, but in essence, I want people to live better. And how do people who enjoy better lives fare?"\n\nSilver looked up. "They... they live longer," he answered, slowly understanding.\n\n"Exactly, Silver," Leopold said with a cackle. "Were we to work together, why, you could live forever. Wouldn't you fancy that?"\n\nSilver suddenly became very interested in what Leopold had to say."
  barrad_friends.2.a:0 "I would... I would so very much!"
  barrad_friends.3.t:0 "Skulls"
  barrad_friends.3.d:0 "Silver eyed the bleached form of what he presumed were zebra skulls. They looked startlingly like that of a pony, and it unnerved him how Asinti seemed to speak unheard words to them. Silver wasn't even sure why he'd come to Asinti's own abode—the mad stallion was talking to skulls!\n\nAsinti's cold eyes shifted. "What brings you here, Silver Star of Wittenland?" He spoke quietly yet with authority.\n\n"Did– did you know them?" Silver asked, trying not to imagine the corpses that the skulls once were.\n\nThe zebra rose to all four, a grimace forming on his face. "Not all of them," he admitted, "but they all deserve respect regardless."\n\nSilver had to fight against baulking at the idea of giving praise to skeletons—to death itself, but his reaction was still evident. "I know of your fears, young one." The elder zebra slowly approached the Wittenlander, and placed a hoof upon his shoulder. "I only wish to stop the institution that causes the needless pain and suffering that always ends in the deaths of innocents."\n\nThe unicorn turned to face the grinning skulls. Had he been born a zebra, how likely would it have been that his skull was part of Asinti's collection? Facing Asinti, Silver asked, "To stop their deaths and those of others?"\n\n"Wherever I am capable of doing so," he stated firmly, his grimace fading. "Why won't you help me to stop the deaths of those in suffering?"\n\nSilver mulled over his words. Perhaps he would never get over the absurdity of the skull collection. Still, he could put his unease aside to save others besides himself."

  barrad_silver.22.d:0 "Truthfully, Silver Star didn't quite know what would happen after he had ascended into a Lich. When he was young, he'd read forbidden passages of powerful mages in the far north who had mastered the art of unlife. Still, those scraps of knowledge seemed to overlook something crucial: the amount a pony would have to sacrifice in order to gain immortality.\n\nSilver Star looked at his foreleg. Once vibrant in color and with neatly combed fur, it was now a shriveled, pale tan that lost patches of fur every time he brushed his hoof across it. It was... disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nHe tried to take solace in his victory over the Pentarchy, though the joy and vindication he had first felt seemed more elusive than ever. Emptiness seemed to be his primary emotion now, despite his best attempts to deny it.\n\nThe Archlich paused as he tried to focus on that phantom feeling. Perhaps... perhaps if he replicated it. If he became more powerful, if he defeated greater foes, then this emptiness might go away."

  barrad_silver.8.d:0 "Recently, Silver had sought to converse with Leopold to pass the time. Despite being a rotting corpse, Leopold contained enough semblance of his former self to hold a conversation... at least, sometimes he could. Even then, Silver felt naught but a great vacuum where once he had enjoyed speaking with the griffon.\n\nOut of desperation, or perhaps foolishness, he commanded one of his undead to attack him in hopes that he would feel fear. Still nothing, he realized, as he tossed aside the now-inert skeleton.\n\nThis was becoming a serious problem. Silver looked down at his foreleg again. Some parts of the bone were starting to show through the various tissues and ligaments, and if he looked closely enough, he could see the magic aura that allowed his body to move in undeath. He briefly wondered if becoming a lich might have been a mistake.\n\nSilver shook his head to rid himself of that notion. No, there was no mistake. He simply hasn't found what would make him truly happy, yet. He simply needed to keep looking, to keep trying...\n\nHis thoughts turned to the Kingdom of Wittenland from which he had been ostracized. A kingdom... yes, that would do it. He needed to build a great kingdom, and then he would find his eternal joy."

The room, steeped in the musty scent of old paper and ink, was his refuge, yet those pages he struggled on now were making him uneasy.\n\nSuddenly, the tranquility of his sanctuary was shattered. Viira, like a gust of wind, breezed in from behind a towering stack of books, her sudden appearance sending a few volumes tumbling to the floor. She retrieved one of fallen books, reading the title aloud with a tinge of sarcasm - „Modern Theory of Nation State Relations” - She arched an eyebrow, looking at Silver Star curiously - What are you doing here all alone?\n\n- Just... nothing- Silver Star replied, his voice barely above a whisper, tinged with a hint of embarrassment.\n\nViira glanced around at the scattered books - That's a lot of nothing - she remarked, handing him the book she had picked up.\n\nSilver Star took it hesitantly and sat back down, a sigh escaping him as he opened the cover - During my education, I might not have paid enough attention to the intricacies of relations between states... or ponies - he admitted quietly.\n\nA soft chuckle escaped Viira, her eyes twinkling with unspoken jokes. Instead of teasing him, she asked - Would you rather be left alone with your books?\n\nHe nodded in silence.\n\nIgnoring it, Viira moved closer, her presence a warm contrast to the cold stillness of the room. Silver Star felt a sudden tightness in his chest, his breath hitching slightly.\n\n- Perhaps we could study together? - she suggested, her voice gentle and inviting.\n\nSilver Star's heart raced, and his eyes widened at the thought - I would be more than happy to - he replied, his voice now steady and filled with anticipation."

We've been looking everywhere for you," he exclaimed, his voice rising with each word. "You won't believe what we've discovered!" He looked around, but due to the lack of response, he started approaching the bed.\n\nJust then, Asinti appeared in the doorway, his expression showing that he was equally moved by their discovery. "You're still under the duvet, I see. Better get up, or our enthusiastic friend here might just drag you out," he joked.\n\nLeopold, continuing with undiminished vigor, said, "What we've discovered is huge, like magical crystalline batteries huge," as he turned towards the bed. "Are you there?"\n\nFrom beneath the folds of the duvet emerged Silver Star, his mane messy and his eyes showing signs of a sleepless night. "I'm here, I'm here," he murmured, his voice heavy with fatigue.\n\nLeopold, with a sympathetic smile, asked, "Rough night?" But before he could continue, something else caught his attention. A sudden movement in the duvet next to Silver Star grew into a noticeable bulge, from which Viira appeared, yawning loudly and stretching wide. It took her a moment to notice the others in the room, and upon realizing she wasn't alone, her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.\n\nThe room fell silent, an awkward tension hanging in the air, only to be broken by Asinti's hearty laughter.\n\n"Leopold, my friend," he said with a playful tone, "I hate to break it to you, but it seems there have been greater discoveries made right here." He gestured towards the door with a knowing look. "Come, I heard our presence is requested somewhere else."\n\nLeopold and Asinti left the room quickly, their steps fading down the hallway, leaving behind a room filled with a kind of silence only seen under a bright night sky."

Contacting the cult that provided them would be a good place to start."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text2:0 " After questioning members of this cult, I discovered that they believe the schematics originate from the deity they worship. This calls for further questioning into the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text3:0 "The deity cultists worship: the "Great Machine". Quite curious. Contacting Inner Circle cultists will be necessary to discover more about the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text4:0 "After contacting the Inner Circle cultists, I received a very strange vision, possibly from their deity. The vision seemed to indicate that it was withering away and in need of something. What kind of god needs something from mortals?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text5:0 "I have heard word that hostile plants recently attacked the mountain villages, but were ultimately defeated. It would be a good idea for me to travel there and investigate the nature of this strange occurrence."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text6:0 " I visited the mountain villages and recovered samples from the hostile plants that attacked them. While there I met an interesting griffon with a magical trinket which he used to protect the villages. I studied the trinket and the warding spell he cast, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text7:0 " Asinti was grateful enough to provide me with samples of living rock he stumbled upon while constructing his absurd temple. This rock seems to have a will of its own. Quite bizarre..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text8:0 "I feel more confident in making a link between the living rock and the hostile plants. The two are connected, but what power could be behind the corruption of the very earth? I am at a loss."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text9:0 "Perhaps the answers I seek lie beneath the ground? I hear Leopold is conducting quite the excavation..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text10:0 "The Titan of living rock uncovered by Leopold's excavation was obviously a magical construct, but creating it would be well beyond the ability of any living mage. It must have been the same power behind Asinti's living rock and the plants that attacked the mountain villages. It's all connected, I know it, but how? I just need to find one more missing piece... Silver Star's library is the only place in Barrad that might contain answers, but I doubt he would ever let me peruse it voluntarily."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text11:0 "Everything now seems much more clear, the time draws near..."
