  BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner:0 "Look for Silver Star"
  BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner_desc:0 "All the pre-hunt preparations had gone smoothly, and everyone was set. Everyone, except Silver Star. The paranoid mage was nowhere to be found. The Count quickly dispatched Asinti and Leopold to find Silver and take him out of his hiding spot."
  BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things:0 "A Matter of True Importance..."
  BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things_desc:0 "Her Magistrate Viira is known for her stubbornness and selfishness. However, she is also ambitious and driven. If she could be convinced to leave her tower and forget her ego, the Pentarchy could have much more fun!"
  BAR_put_an_effort:0 "...After a Second Thought"
  BAR_put_an_effort_desc:0 "After countless failed attempts to get her out of her tower, Viira made it clear that there was nothing in it for her. Ambrosius told her that if she left her tower, she would be rewarded with access to some of his most ancient forbidden texts. After a brief moment of silence, Viira acceded."
  BAR_produce_guns:0 "Gun Production"
  BAR_produce_guns_desc:0 "His Magistrate Leopold is very reserved, often spending days locked up in his tower, away from the outside world. However, as a Herzlander, he has great knowledge of modern weaponry. He has sent a request to the Count to produce a batch of guns. The Count received the request while inebriated and approved it without even bothering to read it."
  BAR_produce_magical_guns:0 "Crystal Rifle Experiment"
  BAR_produce_magical_guns_desc:0 "For years, Leopold has tried to perfect what he calls the "crystal rifle", a rifle capable of running on magic instead of gunpowder. However, he has never been able to perfect it. Until now, that is. Recently, Leopold was able to demonstrate his new rifle to the Count by violently destroying his front yard in a flash of magical light."
  BAR_produce_more_guns:0 "Future Gun Production"
  BAR_produce_more_guns_desc:0 "Leopold has sent another request for guns. The Count received the request whilst being in a relatively sober state. He decided that, to prevent any more requests, he would order the construction of an arms factory on the eastern river. The Count congratulated himself on his brilliance, and then proceeded to drink five pints of beer."
  BAR_gather_peasants:0 "Gather Peasants"
  BAR_gather_peasants_desc:0 "Barrad's leadership has garnered a lot of attention. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be very positive. Dozens of aspiring adventurers enter our lands, seeking to destroy the illustrious Pentarchy. The time has come for us to deal with these wandering "heroes". We shall conscript a levy of peasants from the villages of Barrad to counter these intruders, even if we have to drag them out of their homes." 
  BAR_borrow_peasants:0 "Borrow Peasants"
  BAR_borrow_peasants_desc:0 "After our conscription of dozens of Barradian peasants, His Magistrate Asinti has kindly asked to borrow some peasants in order to further his research. We shall gladly oblige in giving him the resources he needs to better our collective understanding of the world we live in and more."
  BAR_gather_nobles:0 "Gather "Nobles""
  BAR_gather_nobles_desc:0 "Scattered across Barrad are the estates of its wealthiest ponies. These "nobles" spend almost everyday partying with the Count and performing dark magic. They control levies that could prove useful in solving our problem. Since all of these "nobles" are drunkards, this should go off without a cinch." 
  BAR_hunting_party:0 "Hunting Party"
  BAR_hunting_party_desc:0 "We have armed our hunters with weapons and told them the plan. We have thrown a great pre-hunt feast to inspire our allies. Now, it is time to find all the game lurking in our woods.\n\nLet the hunt begin!"

  ### Chapter 2 ###
  BAR_meeting_of_four:0 "Meeting of Four"
  BAR_meeting_of_four_desc:0 "We have discovered... something. A loosely bound codex containing faded ink and crumbling parchment. Whatever knowledge is contained within will be very old. Now who's reading it first?"
  BAR_viira_adventure:0 "A Different Approach"
  BAR_viira_adventure_desc:0 "Although the language is unreadable, it is not unfamiliar either. There are some similarities to the language used by the local cult. Too many to dismiss as a coincidence."
  BAR_contact_cultists:0 "Contact Cultists"
  BAR_contact_cultists_desc:0 "Viira has managed to successfully track down more members of Barrad's shadowy cult. Now all she needs to do is initiate contact and gain their trust. After that, they will hopefully be willing to shed some light on our recent discovery."
  BAR_barrad_machine_concept:0 "Secrets Revealed"
  BAR_barrad_machine_concept_desc:0 "Formalities have concluded with Viira persuading the cultists to consider her worthy of hearing their teachings. The time for introductions is over, now is the time for some answers."
  BAR_viira_resources:0 "A Gift"
  BAR_viira_resources_desc:0 "Viira has made a good impression on the cultists, and several of them were nice enough to provide her with some interesting artifacts in appreciation. Despite their obscurity, these ponies seem to be very well connected."
  BAR_barrad_machine_mystery:0 "A Mystery?"
  BAR_barrad_machine_mystery_desc:0 "Viira approached the cultists in search of answers, but she leaves with more questions than ever. Their beliefs are very strange; what they claim would explain some parts of Barrad's bizarre nature, but not everything. Something bigger is going on here, and Viira is determined to get to the bottom of it."
  BAR_capture_cultists:0 "Capture Cultists"
  BAR_capture_cultists_desc:0 "Asinti has no patience for indulging these maniacs. What they know is of no consequence compared to what they are: ideal candidates for a ritual. Luring them to their dooms will be a simple matter."
  BAR_grand_sacrifice:0 "Grand Sacrifice"
  BAR_grand_sacrifice_desc:0 "Asinti is eager to perform a sacrifice for his divine companion, and all the preparations are complete. Let the blood flow! This offering will gain us much favour, indeed..."
  BAR_elisay_valley_factories:0 "Elisay Valley Manufacturies"
  BAR_elisay_valley_factories_desc:0 "Elisay Valley's high and resource rich peaks make it less affected by Barrad's infamous weather, and a considerable source of the nation's ore and crystals. Together, these traits make the valley a prime candidate for a new industrial park."
  BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming:0 "Valley Terraforming"
  BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming_desc:0 "In the dark ages, our ancestors were limited by the land around them. With projects to clear otherwise unusable terrain being extraordinarily expensive and time consuming. Now, with the power of industry to assist us, we can do in months what may once have taken years to accomplish."
  BAR_alchemy_plantations:0 "Alchemical Plantations"
  BAR_alchemy_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture! This is the foundation on which civilization is built. Asinti knows this and as such has made proposals to create new crops that will be resistant to the extreme of our land, and totally immune to the various strains of blight that plague their less magical brethren."
  BAR_sentient_livestock:0 "Hazardous Terrain Settlements"
  BAR_sentient_livestock_desc:0 "When exposed to big doses of magical energy some plants starts showing their hidden properties, in order to cultivate them we need to settle anomaly ridden regions with permanent villages."
  BAR_new_mine:0 "New Mine"
  BAR_new_mine_desc:0 "Barrad's land houses a cornucopia of crystals. We must extract as much of them as possible. To do so, we will establish new mines and excavate them by any means necessary. Soon the riches deep within these lands will be ours."
  BAR_mining_eq:0 "Mining Equipment"
  BAR_mining_eq_desc:0 "There exists many fundamental truths in this world. The sky is blue, water is wet, and steel is stronger than stone. We'll need new equipment to prove that last one."
  BAR_leopold_research:0 "Crystalic Research"
  BAR_leopold_research_desc:0 "With such an abundance of crystals now at our disposal it would be a shame to have very narrow uses for them. Leopold has already discovered many practical uses for the magical gems, in his spare time but a dedicated team would undoubtedly find even more. The only issue is funding such a team."
  BAR_industrial_eq:0 "Industrial Equipment"
  BAR_industrial_eq_desc:0 "The forge and anvil have served us well for a long, long time but now it's time to lay them to rest. With modern equipment like lathes we will be able to produce far more complex goods of significantly higher quality."
  BAR_leopold_res:0 "Quick Benefits"
  BAR_leopold_res_desc:0 "Leopold's efforts are already paying dividends. The output of these new mining and industrial facilities will greatly aid him in his research. Research that will help bring about a new age for all creatures!"
  BAR_another_party:0 "Another Party"
  BAR_another_party_desc:0 "Things have been unusually quiet around Ambrosius' manor recently. Since it has been a while since the Count's last shindig, it will not be long until he demands another to quell his boredom."
  BAR_another_party_stay_longer:0 "Stay..."
  BAR_another_party_stay_longer_desc:0 "Enjoying yourself? Wait, don't leave! You don't want to know what happened to the last ones that tried to leave... Come closer, there is something we must discuss... erm, what was your name again?"
  BAR_just_a_bit_longer:0 "...a Bit..."
  BAR_just_a_bit_longer_desc:0 "Ah yes, of course, I remember now. Have a seat, I insist. Let us indulge in games and drink! All the while, I shall tell you about the wondrous advancements made possible by my magical experiments."
  BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles:0 "...Longer"
  BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles_desc:0 "Yes, overcoming death itself! Truly extraordinary, is it not? Of course, such a thing would only be possible if you were to help me in acquiring materials for my research..."
  BAR_virra_magic_trick:0 "Party Trick"
  BAR_virra_magic_trick_desc:0 "Viira knows that the best way to get support from wealthy ponies is by impressing them. A little performance can go a long way, it makes them lower their guard and open their coin purses."
  BAR_meeting_of_four_two:0 "Decision to Be Made"
  BAR_meeting_of_four_two_desc:0 "Much has happened since the last meeting of the four Pentarchs, and many things have become clear. It is time to meet once again to agree on what next steps to take, and who should take the lead."

  ### Chapter 3 ###
  BAR_search_for_knowledge:0 "Search for Knowledge"
  BAR_search_for_knowledge_desc:0 "As we begin planning for the reactor, it is important that we keep our eyes open for new information that might help aid in its construction. Getting to the point where its power can be harnessed is absolutely crucial, the future of Barrad depends on it."
  BAR_ambrosius_wants_a_car:0 "A Kind Request"
  BAR_ambrosius_wants_a_car_desc:0 "Ambrosius' imagination has recently become captured by the aesthetics of automobiles, along with their inner workings. It is doubtful he will give up this obsession until he has obtained one to call his own."
  BAR_attack_of_mutant_plants:0 "Wild Plants Problem"
  BAR_attack_of_mutant_plants_desc:0 "It seems a truly bizarre situation is developing in the mountains. We aren't sure how it could be possible, but local villages report sighting angry mutant plants that are attacking anyone that comes close. What is going on?"
  BAR_begin_building:0 "Begin Building"
  BAR_begin_building_desc:0 "At last, the process of planning and preparation is complete. We have uncovered all the knowledge we need to continue forward with our plans, and real progress on the reactor can finally begin."
  BAR_underground_forges:0 "Underground Forges"
  BAR_underground_forges_desc:0 "Leopold sees the wisdom in keeping manufacturies hidden from view and safe from threats. Given the unique difficulties presented by our climate, such subterranean complexes must form the backbone of Barrad's industry if we are to advance."
  BAR_crystals_experiments:0 "Crystal Experiments"
  BAR_crystals_experiments_desc:0 "Few creatures fully appreciate the enormous potential of magical crystals, destructive or otherwise. Using Leopold's specialised facilities, we can study the properties of these crystals to further our understanding of the universe."
  BAR_reactor_research_bonus:0 "This will help in designing the reactor."
  BAR_leopold_tanks:0 "Tools to Maintain"
  BAR_leopold_tanks_desc:0 "During this critical moment, we cannot afford to sit idly and remain content with our military arsenal. We must constantly strive to invent and perfect new weapons of war, for technology is our only hope of survival."
  BAR_leopold_rifles:0 "Weapon Tinkering"
  BAR_leopold_rifles_desc:0 "While some fail to appreciate the intricacies of rifle designs, Leopold is aware of the importance of these weapons, and he knows that improvements can always be made. Our infantry forces will no doubt appreciate the effort."
  BAR_leopold_clockwerks:0 "Autonomous Clockworks"
  BAR_leopold_clockwerks_desc:0 "Leopold's clockworks are truly incredible creations! Capable of moving all on their own, every observer that sees them up close comes away awed by their construction. However, the fact is that these machines are harmless and not very useful, for now..."
  BAR_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Deeper"
  BAR_dig_deeper_desc:0 "As we endeavour to obtain the materials necessary to fuel our industry, we must step up our deep mining efforts. The valuable metals hiding beneath the rock and soil are ripe for recovery, and will be critical as we build new and more advanced war machines."
  BAR_seek_cultist_knowledge:0 "Seek Cultist Knowledge"
  BAR_seek_cultist_knowledge_desc:0 "Viira's investigation has led her to the Inner Circle of Barrad's obscure cult and their home inside a compound deep in the forest. Hopefully she will be able to uncover the secrets hidden inside this isolated enclave."
  BAR_trial_of_the_machine:0 "Trial of the Machine"
  BAR_trial_of_the_machine_desc:0 "It seems these cultists will not reveal their secrets to any outsider unless they complete some sort of initiation rite. They are appalled by the prospect of gifts from their god being looked upon by one who lacks proper reverence. In any case, Viira is prepared to do whatever it takes to prove her worth."
  BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_deeps:0 "Pilgrimage to the Deep"
  BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_deeps_desc:0 "There are whispers of a heavily guarded hallowed chamber that lies beneath the compound, which is said to house something of great importance. Descending to examine this chamber would surely be a fruitful inquiry, assuming the guards are willing to step aside..."
  BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_ancient_machines:0 "Pilgrimage to the Ancient Machines"
  BAR_pilgrimage_to_the_ancient_machines_desc:0 "The cultists are finally willing to let Viira lay eyes on some of the strange relics under their protection. They say they have guarded a large collection of ancient devices for generations, and that the mysterious machines were gifts from their god."
  BAR_power_machines:0 "Power Up Machines"
  BAR_power_machines_desc:0 "Viira cannot deny that these machines are truly astonishing and unlike anything she has ever seen before. She clearly sees the potential contained in these machines, and chooses to activate them to make use of their potential."
  BAR_closer_look:0 "Closer Look"
  BAR_closer_look_desc:0 "Viira cannot deny that these machines are truly astonishing and unlike anything she has ever seen before. Rather than risk disturbing them, she chooses to closely observe the machines and record their design."
  BAR_listen_to_whispers:0 "Listen to Whispers"
  BAR_listen_to_whispers_desc:0 "Sometimes, when all else is silent, Viira hears something; faint voices at the edge of her perception. Strange thoughts are entering her mind, thoughts that are not her own. Somehow, forgotten knowledge is seeping in..."
  BAR_minimal_undead_autonomy:0 "Thinking Undead"
  BAR_minimal_undead_autonomy_desc:0 "Silver Star has long found skeletons somewhat disturbing, but he has been making an effort to overcome this fear. In order to make the most of his undead servants, he has decided to grant them a degree of autonomy as they fulfill their tasks."
  BAR_undead_overseers:0 "Undead Overseers"
  BAR_undead_overseers_desc:0 "Some undead possess greater cognitive capabilities and leadership qualities than others. Such undead are valuable assets, and should be used to keep the rest in line. This will free up Silver Star and allow him to focus on his important research."
  BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks:0 "Simplify Factory Tasks..."
  BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our undead factory workforce is not performing well at all. They are incapable of following the simplest instructions! It seems we need to make things even simpler for them before they are capable of operating at the level we require."
  BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_leopold_help:0 "...Or Use Mechanical Aid"
  BAR_simplyfy_factory_tasks_leopold_help_desc:0 "Our undead factory workforce is not performing up to Silver Star's expectations. Fortunately, Leopold indicates that he may be able to help with the matter. He has suggested that some of the more complex factory tasks might be automated, and even proposed designs for the machines."
  BAR_streamline_production:0 "Streamline Production"
  BAR_streamline_production_desc:0 "Thanks to our adaptations, the output of undead-operated factories is soaring! The process of industrialising the country continues to move forward. Another brilliant contribution to Barrad from the magnanimous Silver Star."
  BAR_architectural_thought:0 "Temple Construction"
  BAR_architectural_thought_desc:0 "Asinti demands the building of a grand new temple where he will be able to conduct further research into cross-world communion and summoning. We must do as he asks. After all, he is extremely wise, being privy to knowledge denied to other mortals."
  BAR_bring_architects_zebra:0 "Zebra Architects"
  BAR_bring_architects_zebra_desc:0 "Asinti still has great fondness for the building style of his kin. For his temple, nothing other than zebra architects will do! It should be a simple matter to lure in some foolish Kásans with promises of riches if they aid us."
  BAR_bring_architects_deets:0 "Deer Architects"
  BAR_bring_architects_deets_desc:0 "For this construction, there is no need to remain bound by tradition. Deer buildings are compact and efficient, and using their style would bring a certain elegance to the temple. A quick trip to Austurland is all it would take to "persuade" a few deer to help us out."
  BAR_local_resources:0 "Local Resources"
  BAR_local_resources_desc:0 "Acquiring the capital needed for the temple will be slightly difficult, as it seems Ambrosius can't be bothered to assist at all. No matter, we can get all the resources we need simply by making use of the land. Let's get digging!"
  BAR_foreign_resources:0 "Foreign Resources"
  BAR_foreign_resources_desc:0 "Acquiring the capital needed for the temple will be slightly difficult, as it seems Ambrosius can't be bothered to assist at all. We must look outward for a way to attain the resources we need. This is going to require quite the sales pitch..."
  BAR_bring_architects_ponies:0 "Pony Decorating"
  BAR_bring_architects_ponies_desc:0 "There is no shortage of ponies in Barrad who would be more than capable of applying the finishing touches to the temple. While it might not be the flashiest, the job will get done on time."
  BAR_bring_architects_griffons:0 "Griffon Decorating"
  BAR_bring_architects_griffons_desc:0 "Although finding skilled candidates may be difficult, griffon aesthetic sensibilities would greatly elevate the grandeur of the temple. We must do all we can to locate qualified griffons for the job."
  BAR_living_rock:0 "Living Rock"
  BAR_living_rock_desc:0 "The temple is complete! Although, while constructing it, workers stumbled across something truly bizarre. It appears some of the rock they were tunneling into is alive and has a will of its own! Asinti is completely baffled by this living rock; perhaps one of his colleagues might have some insight?"

  ### Chapter 4 ###
  BAR_progress_is_being_made:0 "Progress is Made"
  BAR_progress_is_being_made_desc:0 "Preparations are complete and construction is finally ready to begin in earnest. Soon the reactor will be complete, and Barrad will be launched into a new age. Very soon..."
  BAR_party_never_stops:0 "Party Never Stops"
  BAR_party_never_stops_desc:0 "It seems some particularly insolent fools have expressed exhaustion at the pace of the Count's festivities. Who are they to tell Ambrosius what to do? It's over when he says it's over, and this party is just getting started!"
  BAR_initial_spark:0 "Initial Spark"
  BAR_initial_spark_desc:0 "At long last, construction of the reactor is nearly complete. In a short while the device's first tests will be ready to begin, a momentous occasion for all those who worked to bring this wondrous creation to life."
  BAR_strike_the_earth_focus:0 "Strike the Earth!"
  BAR_strike_the_earth_focus_desc:0 "Our previous underground excursions up to this point have yielded very little, probably because we have not descended far enough. However, Leopold has devised a plan for us to dig deeper than any creatures have before! Who knows what secrets we might uncover?"
  BAR_strike_the_earth_focus_tooltip:0 "We shall begin a deep underground mining expedition."
  BAR_clockwerk_dev:0 "Gears and Bolts"
  BAR_clockwerk_dev_desc:0 "Leopold's clockwork machines are currently seen as mere curiosities without practical value, but this will not always be the case. Further development will greatly improve their function and design, opening up new worlds of possibilities."
  BAR_clockwerk_dev_reactor:0 "Simple autonomous clockworks can help with maintaining the reactor."
  BAR_clockwerk_military:0 "Military Applications for Clockworks"
  BAR_clockwerk_military_desc:0 "Clockworks do not sleep. They do not hunger for food or thirst for water. They never lose morale. They always follow orders. In short, they are the perfect soldiers!"
  BAR_clockwerk_workers:0 "Non-Specialised Clockworks"
  BAR_clockwerk_workers_desc:0 "Rather than overspecialising and narrowing the areas in which clockworks can operate, it would be best to design them to be smart and versatile. Such adaptable machines will greatly help Leopold in his research."
  BAR_clockwerk_industrial:0 "Industrial Applications for Clockworks"
  BAR_clockwerk_industrial_desc:0 "Machines are capable of performing far more work than a pony, far more efficiently. We must leverage the labour of these clockworks and put them to work in Barrad's factories!"
  BAR_sanctuary_for_poor:0 "Sanctuary for the Weak"
  BAR_sanctuary_for_poor_desc:0 "Asinti has a vision for a better society, where all creatures live in peace and equality. One where none are slaves! Already, thousands are flocking to become part of this new utopia."
  BAR_reactor_integration:0 "Device Integration"
  BAR_reactor_integration_desc:0 "We can reap many benefits by connecting our grand temple to the nearly complete reactor. Perhaps combining the two will even enhance our understanding of the reactor's nature?"
  BAR_has_builded_temple:0 "Started construction of the temple."
  BAR_separate_entity:0 "Separate Entity"
  BAR_separate_entity_desc:0 "Although our grand temple and the nearly complete reactor are in close proximity, these two great engineering wonders should remain separated. Many would have disapproved of the effort, anyway."
  BAR_undead_army:0 "Hidden Potential"
  BAR_undead_army_desc:0 "Silver Star is pleased with the performance of his undead servants, so much so that he wishes to create a true undead army! Their potential is great, sure to surpass all feeble efforts of the living."
  BAR_commanding_constructs:0 "Commanding Constructs"
  BAR_commanding_constructs_desc:0 "The common undead soldier, for all their ferocity, lacks the tactical mind required for complex planning and manoeuvring. Specialised undead must be created and empowered with the skills needed to command the army."
  BAR_bind_undead_to_undead:0 "Binding Net"
  BAR_bind_undead_to_undead_desc:0 "Different undead may have different gifts and capabilities, but they share a common purpose all the same. Soldier and commander shall be bound together, so that all will obey Silver Star's command."
  BAR_freedom_with_limits:0 "Freedom With Limits"
  BAR_freedom_with_limits_desc:0 "In order to operate effectively in the field, undead troops must be able to adapt to rapidly changing situations and respond appropriately. Soldiers and commanders shall be given this leeway during battle. However, this autonomy will not extend far beyond the resolution of the engagement."
  BAR_undead_command_chain:0 "Chain of Command"
  BAR_undead_command_chain_desc:0 "Any army needs a well-defined command hierarchy, and an undead army is no different. It must be organised so that Silver Star can make it clear to all how he expects his orders to be carried out."

  #TODO: check descriptions below for errors and if they make any sense
  #rewrite if needed
  BAR_friend_state_of_our_home_desc:0 "Chaos reigns supreme in Barrad as the cultists, like ravenous predators, lay waste to lands forgotten by gods. Those who hold any sort of power and influence exploit the turmoil for their own gains. Yet, amidst this tempest of strife, the four unlikely friends plan how to make things right."
  BAR_friend_join_gasienica_desc:0 "As his master teeters on the brink of death, Gąsienica employs every resource at his disposal to uphold the dominion of Ambrosius. Despite a turbulent history marked by fleeting hostilities, aligning forces with him could prove to be a prudent course of action."
  BAR_friend_enemies_within_desc:0 "Ambrosius meticulously crafted a fragile power structure that enabled his secession from Wittenland. With him gone, the entire thing crumbled. To endure and thrive, we must reclaim our dominion over the realm."
  BAR_friend_ultimatum_to_influential_desc:0 "Ambrosius did not have an iron grip on the entire Barrad. Numerous formidable individuals seek to exploit the current chaos, and it becomes imperative for us to assert our dominance and remind them of the true authority."
  BAR_friend_train_local_militias_desc:0 "Ambrosius may not have been benevolent toward his subjects, but Gąsienica sees potential utility in arming them. The notion of empowerment, albeit in the midst of chaos, could play a crucial role in reclaiming control over the tumultuous realm."
  BAR_friend_griffon_friends_desc:0 "In times of need you can count on your friends, and Gąsienica has many friends among his fellow griffons. Yet, the looming question remains - will they accept his recently forged alliances?"
  BAR_friend_welcome_defectors_desc:0 "It seems that some of those who sought to exploit our current situation possess more intelligence that what their previous actions suggested. They've opted to align with our cause, and while a welcome is due, precautions must be taken to secure their unwavering loyalty."
  BAR_friend_operation_tempest_desc:0 "Time is running short. We must assemble our allies and embark on an armed campaign against every last potential threat against our rule in Barrad."
  BAR_friend_operation_lomnica_desc:0 "Banditry a persistent scourge of Barrad, requires an unwavering response. Collaborating with our recent allies among the common ponies, we shall embark on a sweeping operation across the countryside, ensuring the eradication of this menace once and for all.."
  BAR_friend_prepare_reactor_ignition_desc:0 "Amidst all challenges, we must persist in pursuing our objectives. The potential power from the reactor could hold the key to resolving the problems we confront. Yet, with each step forward, doubts linger and multiply..."
  BAR_friend_ignite_reactor_desc:0 "Our path forward is unobstructed, and we shall proceed with our plans towards reactor. If the gods harbor any concern for us mere mortals, may their watchful eyes be upon us.."
  BAR_friend_meet_ambrosius_desc:0 "The Mad Count has awoken from what seemed to be an eternal slumber, but he changed. No more do his halls resound with maniacal laughter and hedonistic revelry, instead his voice now beared the tones of reason. And he seeks an audience."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_desc:0 "Merely fending off cultist assaults and raids is a futile endeavor. We must seize the initiative and confront them on their own territory, maintaining relentless pressure."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_mountains_desc:0 "Within our mountains lies countless underground structures, whether formed naturally, excavated by diamond dogs, or shaped by other forces. If these depths harbor cultists, we must either subdue them or entomb all within beneath layers of unyielding rock.."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_elysium_desc:0 "Elysium the largest city in Barrad, harbors a subtle cultist enclave. While not overtly violent, this cell engages in covert acts of sabotage and other clandestine activities that elude our knowledge. It demands our decisive intervention."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_roughers_desc:0 "The eastern forests are great for two purposes, concealing and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Barrad. Both we and the cultists are well aware of this, emphasizing the need to thwart their covert operations."
  BAR_friend_occupy_grand_sanctuary_desc:0 "The grand sanctuary evokes the most unsettling feelings. The last encounter Pentarchy and Gąsienica had within its sacred halls involved a battle to liberate Ambrosius. Yet, upon departing, a lingering sense that something crucial had been overlooked has persisted to this very day. Now, they are compelled to rectify it..."
  BAR_friend_enemies_without_desc:0 "We find ourselves inadequately equipped for the impending conflict, yet it will come, whether we desire it or not. Perhaps launching an offensive against our adversaries before they amass greater power than us is the best option we have."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_desc:0 "It is beyond doubt that our southern neighbor will inevitably launch an assault. Observing the rapid expansion of their industrial might, it would be wiser to engage in conflict sooner rather than later."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_bonus_desc:0 "We must press forward, in the face of potential defeat, the cost becomes inconsequential."
  BAR_friend_convert_factories_desc:0 "Our resources are primarily tailored for internal conflicts. We must maximize their utility to the fullest extent possible for the incoming war."
  BAR_friend_seize_factories_desc:0 "Barrad harbors weapon manufacturers, predominantly catering to the black market in other nations. To stand any chance against external threats, we must seize control of their enterprises."
  BAR_friend_employ_mercenaries_desc:0 "Despite Gąsienica's disdain for mercenaries, numerous groups operate in our region, and undoubtedly those recruits will prove useful."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_desc:0 "Austurland's intentions remain uncertain, but Gąsienica believes that abandoning them would leave our flank vulnerable in the event of a potential conflict with the River Federation. It appears we must take a gamble..."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_bonus_desc:0 "Our current predicament has turned us into cornered animals, and so we must embrace that essence. With all of its ferocity."
  BAR_friend_fortify_border_desc:0 "Having secured our southern border, the imperative now lies in fortifying the western frontier to dissuade any potential invasions. May it allow us to focus our efforts on any potential threat from Riverlands."
  BAR_friend_light_of_the_star_desc:0 "In recent weeks, a cascade of unforeseen events unfolded. In his mastery of the unpredictable, Ambrosius seized the opportunity to introduce yet another layer of the unexpected. For better or worse, it is to be seen."
  BAR_friend_prince_of_wittenland_desc:0 "Much to his surprise, the ponies of Barrad responded positively upon learning that Silver Star had assumed leadership of the county. Perhaps they harbor hopes of a reunion with Wittenland, or maybe their trust is placed in the belief that he would govern akin to his sister."
  BAR_friend_letter_to_sister_desc:0 "Silver Star summoned the necessary courage to start writing a letter to his sister, a gesture that piqued the curiosity of certain deer."
  BAR_friend_fight_for_friendship_desc:0 "Even in the darkest recesses of his nightmares, Silver Star never envisioned the prospect of losing someone dear to him. Until now, he hadn't deemed anyone worthy of risking his life for. Yet, an unfamiliar power surges through his veins, filling him with determination to fight for the sake of his friends"
  BAR_friend_move_to_wittenburgh_desc:0 "Even with the Wittenland crown secured, our Riverland neighbors understandably still harbor suspicions about us. Perhaps relocating to Wittenburgh could dispell the notion of us being mere invaders and fostering trust."
  BAR_friend_serving_justice_desc:0 "Silver Star has learned how forgive for many transgressions, yet sororicide stands resolute outside the bounds of pardon. Unfortunately for those in Wittenland, he has also acquired the art of confronting challenges and not evading the responsibility"
  BAR_friend_homecoming_desc:0 "Victory is ours; the interlopers have been expelled from Wittenland. Now is the moment to unfurl the banner of three crowns across the lands."
  BAR_friend_river_federation_membership_desc:0 "Our circumstances are curious, for Wittenland long stood as a member of the River Federation. With our newfound rule, does this entitle us to membership as well? We must find out."
  BAR_friend_viira_and_silver_diplomacy_desc:0 "Silver Star found himself ill-prepared for the multifaceted challenges of governance, with diplomacy proving to be a particularly formidable adversary. Fortunately, no obstacle exists that cannot be overcome with the support of a friend."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff_desc:0 "Even united both Wittenland and Barrad lacked the economic prowess observed in the nations to the far west. Perhaps we could ask for some assistance?"
  BAR_friend_evi_griffons_diplomacy_desc:0 "Despite the well-known tensions between Wittenland and the griffons in the west, and Silver Star's personal reservations towards them, it seems imperative to extend a symbolic gesture of friendship in an effort to thaw the icy relations."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff2_desc:0 "Neither Viira nor Silver Star possess extensive experience in the realm of business, but everypony has to begin somewhere as securing foreign investments could significantly benefit us."
  BAR_friend_diplomacy_getting_somebody_competent_desc:0 "Despite their earnest intentions and best efforts, the two friends found themselves empty-hoofed after their diplomatic endeavor. Fortunately, there are more seasoned individuals just waiting to be called upon for assistance."
  BAR_friend_riverlands_diplomacy_desc:0 "Ambrosius appeared genuinely surprised that it took Silver Star this long to seek his assistance. Though when he was his age, he likely preferred spending time with mares rather than a leader of a rogue state."
  BAR_friend_merchant_dynasty_desc:0 "Ambrosius' immense fortune was not meticulously built from scratch; he inherited it, just as his father did before him, and countless others in his lineage. Each sought to pass on more than they received, and Ambrosius emerged as perhaps the shrewdest among them all."
  BAR_friend_one_hoof_washes_the_other_desc:0 "To get something from somepony, you must present an enticing offer aligned with their desires. However, exercise caution not to overtly reveal your intentions, for that might prompt them to demand more. It's a rather straightforward principle, wouldn't you agree, my young friend?"
  BAR_friend_buy_our_stuff_desc:0 "Barrad harbors abundant untapped resources that could serve as a valuable asset. Our endeavor should focus on securing potential buyers to feed into our burgeoning industrial pursuits."
  BAR_friend_silver_tongue_desc:0 "Ambrosius possesses exceptional gifts, and among them, his extraordinary social skills stand out. There is no being in existence with whom he cannot initiate a conversation, delving deep until a profound acquaintance is established."
  BAR_friend_regional_interventionism_desc:0 "To everypony's surprise, White Star was not only willig to assist her brother in ruling after losing her crown but also exhibited enthusiasm for the role. Perhaps shedding the constraints of monarchy played a part, or she simply reveled in the return of her sibling. Regardless, she advised adopting a more proactive stance in regional diplomacy, acknowledging that blood had already been spilled."
  BAR_friend_conquer_steppe_desc:0 "Those steppe griffons are impervious to reason. We need a swift resolution to prevent any future raids into our lands."
  BAR_friend_aproach_cossacs_desc:0 "As the government shifts on the steppe, an opportunity arises to cultivate alliances and safeguard our heartland from potential raids."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_deal_desc:0 "Grifofns in Gryphus always were well wersed in buissness, they surely will understand importance of cooperation between our countries for our mutual security and potentialy proserity."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_not_for_long_desc:0 "Gryphus looms as a potantial threat, demanding our attention before it spirals beyond control. Surprisingly, there is a measure of support for this prospective invasion, particularly among Ambrosius' feathered friends from the southern moutains."
  BAR_friend_bandits_and_communists_desc:0 "Communist uprisings, erratic rulers, famine. By venturing into those lands, we extend a favor to the griffons. Simultaneously, we thwart a looming threat to our region."
  BAR_friend_lushi_ultimatum_desc:0 "The gateway to absolute peace in Evi Valley lies in the small nation of Lushi. A diplomatic approach to persuade them to join our cause is advisable. However, it must be made explicitly clear that rejecting our proposal will carry significant consequences."
  BAR_friend_bring_order_to_helquil_desc:0 "Our attention seldom graced that distant realm. Yet, as our sphere of influence extended to this place forsaken by spirits, intervention became imperative."
  BAR_friend_ruin_has_come_desc:0 "Ruin has come to Barrad. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed lands. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth as we were spreading the realm of death and madness! But it can be reclaimed from the ravenous clutching shadows, rebuild into new house, opulent and imperial."
  BAR_friend_now_what_desc:0 "The mantle of rulership rests uneasy on Silver Star's shoulders, a responsibility he never envisioned. Amidst the recent tumultuous events, he finds himself adrift and overwhelmed. Fortunately, steadfast friends stand ready to guide him through the uncharted waters."
  BAR_friend_2_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy's reign, strength dictated supremacy - a simplistic rule leading to inevitable chaos when the strongest vanished. It becomes imperative to forge new societal structure, one rooted in collaboration rather than fear."
  BAR_friend_3_desc:0 "Despite the turmoil, the inhabitants of Barrad share more common ground than they realize. With the alleviation of constant fear and strugge for basic resources, it becomes imperative for them to rekindle the sense of unity they have seemingly forgotten."
  BAR_friend_4_desc:0 "Collaboration holds its merit, but it was trust that steered Pentarchy away from its dark course. This invaluable lesson gradually permeates the understanding of the common ponies too."
  BAR_friend_5_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad diligently toil, liberated from oppressive rule, banditry, and cultist influence. They rebuild infrastructure, rejuvenate trade, and witness the resurgence of circulated goods."
  BAR_friend_6_desc:0 "When working together we can exchange not only what we need to survive but also ideas that comes to our mind. It seems live two sided sword considering that cooperation between pentarchs focused on building a reactor leaded to time of strive, but it also holds much potential for good."
  BAR_friend_7_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad have proven to be remarkably innovative, perhaps driven by the scarcity of basic resources. With the elimination of survival concerns, their ingenuity can now be harnessed for more constructive purposes."
  BAR_friend_8_desc:0 "Having savored the fruits of prosperity and freedom, our populace will not relinquish them without a fight. To meet the demand for self-defense, numerous new arms manufacturers have commenced their operations."
  BAR_friend_first_census_desc:0 "Asinti harbors ambivalent sentiments about the situation they find themselves in. On one hoof, he yearns to place his trust in his friend Silver Star and the purported transformation within him. On the other, he grapples with the realization that they are inadvertently perpetuating a broken system he had sworn to dismantle. The notion of a census might serve as a feeble pretext, yet it stands as a potential means to quell the disquieting thoughts that assail him."
  BAR_friend_country_side_census_desc:0 "Silent and mostly serene, the fields and hills of Barrad provide an ideal sanctuary for contemplation, where one can ruminate on past actions and deliberate upon the course of future endeavors."
  BAR_friend_infrastructure_desc:0 "Traveling from settlement to settlement posed a perpetual challenge in Barrad, unless for those with wings. Asinti pondered why local communities couldn't unite to address this issue, constructing roads and bridges for their collective benefit. The notion lingered prominently in Asinti's mind."
  BAR_friend_many_cultures_of_barrad_desc:0 "Traversing the hilltops of Barrad left Asinti and his followers in awe of similarities and subtle distinctions among the various communities. Despite the pervasive influence of cultist beliefs in this region, the diversity observed proved both unsettling and inspiring, showcasing resilience amid the challenging circumstances faced by these inhabitants."
  BAR_friend_common_undestanding_desc:0 "Despite their long stay in Barrad, encountering a zebra remained an extraordinary event for most locals. Consequently, as they traveled, Asinti and his followers found themselves frequently sought after for assistance or guidance. Word spread from village to village, gradually turning the attention of many towards the striped preacher and his teachings for the common folk."
  BAR_friend_visit_in_asinti_temple_desc:0 "Lately Asinti has exhibited a noticeable change. He dedicates more hours to his temple, engages in fewer conversations, and wanders about contemplating. We should investigate the nature of his activities within the temple."
  BAR_friend_clockwork_asisted_work_desc:0 "Lot of workon the countryside is manual labor. Asinti suggested to Leopold that they could change it using his clockwork machines."
  BAR_friend_land_reclamation_desc:0 "Much of the rural Barrad lies in ruin. Asinti could not walk past it and began organising local comunities into clearing actions."
  BAR_friend_anti_anomaly_work_desc:0 "In a realm rife with magical anomalies, the term "normal life" loses its meaning. Asinti recognizes the challenge it poses for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of magic. He believes it's his duty not to abandon these people in their struggle against such formidable issues."
  BAR_friend_civ_industry_desc:0 "Having traversed the lands, Asinti couldn't dismiss the plight of the ponies enduring subpar conditions in Barrad. Enlisting the aid of his friends, he contemplates orchestrating community-driven construction initiatives to elevate the standards of housing."
  BAR_friend_mil_industry_desc:0 "As Asinti tells his stories of the struggle for freedom and the imperative of emancipation thought strenght of a unit, a curious development transpires: the common ponies starts enlarging previously estabilished local militias. Like mushrooms sprouting after rainfall, fresh factories emerge to satiate this burgeoning appetite for strenght."
  BAR_friend_dev_up_desc:0 "Asinti couldn't recall the last time he felt a genuine sense of accomplishment. He perpetually pursued an elusive ideals, a spirit that defied capture the closer he approached. How many beings did he overlook in his relentless pursuit? It is about time to change it, starting with his friends and his own son."
  BAR_friend_barradian_academy_of_applied_science_desc:0 "Leopold refused to surrender his lifelong obsession easily. Despite Silver Star's rejection of the proposal to reconstruct the reactor and ascend to the divine status akin to alicorn princesses in the distant west, Leopold resolved to explore alternative avenues to achieve his objective. Perhaps taking a step back was essential, assembling proficient individuals from Barrad and beyond might kindle a fresh spark of inspiration."
  BAR_friend_electrical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Electricity briefly captivated Leopold, as he speculated on its immense potential, despite its inability to rival mechanical energy as a machinery power source and appearing nearly redundant in the realm of magical engineering, he sensed that there might be overlooked possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mechanical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Good old cogs and bolts, the force propelling the world forward. Since constructing an automated peeler to assist his mother during his early days, Leopold had devoted his life to crafting increasingly remarkable automatons. Yet, even with a lifetime of accumulated knowledge and expertise, an external perspective might unveil something valuable."
  BAR_friend_magical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "In the realm of griffon researchers, scientists and inventors, Leopold stood as a paragon of arcane knowledge, with only a few who could rival him. His inventions were unmatched. However, throughout history, there were instances when somegriff entirely unfamiliar with the subject stumbled upon what others considered impossible. This might be one such case."
  BAR_friend_renowned_genius_desc:0 "Leopold found it unsurprising that many sought to collaborate with him or learn from his expertise. However, what truly astonished him was the wealth of knowledge he acquired through these collaborations. It offered a new perspective on the vastness of what he had yet to learn."
  BAR_friend_high_automation_desc:0 "Due to influx of new ideas and guidance of Asinti and Leopold new levels of automation was achieved in Barrad both in industry and agriculture."
  BAR_friend_sharing_knowledge_of_arcane_desc:0 "With the newfound approach of not hoarding knowledge like a precious treasure, the realm witnessed ideas and discoveries blossoming like flowers in the spring."
  BAR_friend_invite_other_to_study_magic_desc:0 "Once a secluded nation, safeguarding our magical secrets from the external world. Yet, now a deep feeling urges us to unveil the secrets of magic that we've unraveled throughout the passing years. Perhaps, in turn, the outside world may reciprocate this gesture of goodwill?"
  BAR_friend_everything_will_be_fine_desc:0 "The long journey weighed heavily on everyone in Barrad, particularly on the five pentarchs. However, one among them harbors deep concerns about the uncertainties the future might unfold. Are these apprehensions justified?"
  BAR_friend_agriculture_mechanization_desc:0 "Amidst intense negotiations and myriad conversations, Asinti successfully persuaded Leopold to embark on the ambitious undertaking he envisioned. The aspiration? To propel the Barradian countryside into a contemporary era where the toil of muscles becomes obsolete. A vision where common folk not only sustain themselves from the land but also contribute to the welfare of their entire communities."
  BAR_new_southern_friends_desc:0 "The fear among the creatures of Kasa was palpable, expecting conquest and enslavement, only to find our arrival upon their shores. We lack the necessary administrative infrastructure, the goodwill of the locals, and even a legitimate claim to these lands. Governing will prove to be a interesting challenge indeed."
  BAR_kasa_1_desc:0 "Numerous among our subjects have sought refuge in Kasa, drawn by its promises of sanctuary. Understandable, indeed. Yet, with our newfound commitment to change, this exodus could prove beneficial to our governance in those territories."
  BAR_kasa_2_desc:0 "As our coastline extends, the naval industry emerges as a pivotal component in safeguarding our security and asserting strategic dominance over maritime trade routes."
  BAR_kasa_3_desc:0 "Ambrosius advocates for a close intertwining of the economies of Barrad and Kasa, lest we spawn a parallel economic structure. There might be merit in it."
  BAR_kasa_4_desc:0 "Kasa has never had a robust network of land connections to Barrad, a fact that seemed inconsequential during our isolation. However, the time has come to alter this circumstance."
  BAR_kasa_5_desc:0 "The Kasans are a proud creatures, unyielding in their freedom. Surprisingly, we have no intention of challenging this aspect of their nature. Granting them a measure of autonomy seems only reasonable, the least we can offer."
  BAR_kasa_6_desc:0 "The passage of time has seen our southern border extend to the sea. For the Kasans, we have proven not to be the monsters they once feared, nor mere invaders seeking plunder. Perhaps the merging of our two realms is now within reach."
  BAR_our_deer_friends_desc:0 "The eastern deers have long been a source of trouble, their presence a thorn in the side of peace and stability. Perhaps it is in the best interest of all, ourselves included, that they now fall under our dominion?"
  BAR_olv_1_desc:0 "In a surge of inspiration, Silver Star suggested a course rarely taken with our neighbor: dialogue. Could there be reasonable minds among the deers, waiting to be heard and understood?"
  BAR_olv_2_desc:0 "It is had to distinguish what once stood there, and destruction wrought by our invasion. Regardless, it falls upon us to offer both resources and direction in the reconstruction efforts."
  BAR_olv_3_desc:0 "As befits a nation forged in the crucible of conflict, the craft of weaponry holds sway over both  society and economy. With strategic vision and ample resources, the arms industry may flourish, while casting us in a favorable light."
  BAR_olv_4_desc:0 "Never before have we found reason to link our realms, save for the occasional exchange of local goods across the river. Today, however, marks a shift in this paradigm."
  BAR_olv_5_desc:0 "In the absence of a reliable local administrative framework, our efforts to govern these lands demand heightened attention. We must exert ourselves doubly to ensure that the deers heed our counsel and guidance."
  BAR_olv_6_desc:0 ""Like it or not, we are here to stay" said Gąsienica when adressing grievances of the local lord."
  BAR_new_south_desc:0 "Amidst the vast disparities among the three southern realms, by magic or miracle we have succeeded in creating a semblance of governance. Remarkably, the inhabitants therein appear to coexist, if not with fervent affection, then at least with a glimmer of friendship."
  BAR_friend_miliatry_reform_desc:0 "From the moment he ascended to his position, Gąsienica persistently implored Ambrosius to form a substantial military force for the defense of both himself and the realm. However, intricate and sensitive political dynamics that led to Ambrosius' rise thwarted these pleas. Now, with the entire county in disarray, there is no rationale against establishing a formidable army."
  BAR_friend_desperate_employment_desc:0 "The core of our new military force lies what was once Ambrosius' personal army, yet we require additional soldiers to reinforce their ranks swiftly. Fortunately, a multitude of our subjects willingly steps forward to combat the deranged cultists who threaten to engulf their homes in flames."
  BAR_friend_employ_adventurers_desc:0 "Gąsienica harbors contempt for those self-proclaimed adventurers traversing the realm stirring up strife. However, with the allure of gold and glory, they can be swayed to lend their services as mercenaries."
  BAR_friend_scavenger_army_desc:0 "In our dearth of essential equipment, our primary focus must shift to the retrieval of weaponry from our vanquished adversaries."
  BAR_friend_wake_up_sleeping_knights_desc:0 "In his younger days Gąsienica heard legends of griffon knights sleeping in the mountains, awaiting to be called in the hour of need. One can only wonder if the legends are true, but the hour of need surely had come."
  BAR_friend_convince_dragons_desc:0 "Nestled within our mountains lie dormant dragons, guarding their treasures in the deepest of caverns. Ordinarily, rousing these majestic creatures would be a perilous endeavor, requiring the expertise of formidable mages. However, Gąsienica holds firm in his conviction that the second most potent force in the world, gold, can manage this situation and get us some allies."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The arms borne by our soldiers could easily find a place within the annals of a museum. It becomes imperative to embark on the development of modern weapon systems."
  BAR_friend_engineers_recon_desc:0 "Barrad terrain demands precision in troop movement, requiring an in-depth understanding of the obstacles and challenges that lie ahead."
  BAR_friend_engineer_corps_desc:0 "Given our modest forces, the strategic integration of field fortifications becomes imperative to level the playing field."
  BAR_friend_logistic_desc:0 "Count Ambrosius' forces sustained themselves through the land, a method effective when they functioned as mere thugs. However, for a modern army, this approach proves insufficient."
  BAR_friend_radio_desc:0 "Barrad hosts swift messengers, with Gąsienica being a prime example. However, the crucial skill of coordinating military operations across vast areas is one we cannot overlook. The future belongs to the radio."
  BAR_friend_anti_air_desc:0 "Competing in air warfare against nations with superior production capabilities poses a formidable challenge. Our strategy should pivot towards negating the aerial advantage of our adversaries through the deployment of anti-air equipment."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "Gąsienica firmly belives in the crucial role of regular soldiers during the battle, and to maximize their utility they need as powerfull weapons as we can provide them."
  BAR_friend_anti_tank_desc:0 "To adequately bolster our troops, we must furnish them with the capability to engage heavily armored adversaries."
  BAR_friend_artillery_desc:0 "Our current deficiency lies in the absence of suitable artillery to reinforce the advancement of our soldiers. We must prioritize the development of this arm or risk finding ourselves incapable of breaking through enemy lines."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_desc:0 "We must mobilize additional production capabilities to ensure a continuous supply of new equipment for our troops."
  BAR_friend_artillery_2_desc:0 "Not so long ago consulting Ambrosius, Leopold, or Viira regarding anything related to weaponry would undoubtedly yield the sentiment that bigger equates to better. There could be some merit in that."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_2_desc:0 "Currently our industrial capacity adequately provides the weaponry we require. However, there is a pressing need to consider expanding our existing factories to enhance our resilience in the event of disruptions to the supply lines."
  BAR_friend_light_tanks_desc:0 "Possessing armored units undoubtedly bestows a strategic advantage, but their utility in mountainous terrain remains limited. Nevertheless, there is merit in exploring the possibility of developing lighter variants capable of navigating challenging landscapes."
  BAR_friend_rocket_experiments_desc:0 "Leopold has developed interesting plans for a novel form of projectile propulsion. Although its strategic applications within our armed forces are still limited, delving into this field could unveil untapped possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_3_desc:0 "As our weapons become increasingly sophisticated, our factories must expand to accommodate the rising production costs."
  BAR_friend_medium_tanks_desc:0 "After a series of tests with light armored vehicles, it became evident that they cannot fulfill the role we envisioned for them. A new tank design must be created, featuring enhanced firepower and armor, yet remaining light enough to navigate challenging terrain."
  BAR_friend_independent_military_units_desc:0 "Empowering smaller units with significant autonomy in their operations provides them with heightened flexibility and better adaptability to fulfill their assigned missions. This approach also alleviates the burden on higher command, allowing Gąsienica to oversee more things simultaneously."
  BAR_friend_mountaineers_desc:0 "While most of our soldiers know very well hot to live and fight in mountains and hills of Barrad we still can select individuals that do it best and form specialized divisions."
  BAR_friend_mountain_expertise_desc:0 "Born amidst these towering peaks, destined to draw our final breaths amidst their rugged embrace. We are the but a humble children of these mountains, none know their terrain as we do, none are as adept in the art of warfare amid their craggy expanse."
  BAR_friend_conscription_system_desc:0 "For too long, Barrad has relied upon hastily raised levies, hired swords, or scant bands of seasoned warriors. It is time we forge a more dependable foundation. A system of conscription must be erected, binding our people to the defense of their homeland."
  BAR_friend_harmonic_conscription_system_desc:0 "Change sweeps over us like a gap wind, reshaping the very rock beneath our paws and hooves. No longer must we compel our people into the ranks of our army. Instead, they flock to our banners willingly, their fervor burning bright as the star."
  BAR_friend_mil_factories_desc:0 "In these turbulent times, the demands upon our army for equipment are ceaseless. We must possess the capacity to meet these demands without fail."
  BAR_friend_equipment_simplification_desc:0 "In the annals of Barrad's history, prosperity has been but a distant dream. Yet, from the crucible of hardship, our creatures have honed a skill indispensable in the craft of weaponry -  the art of resourcefulness."
  BAR_friend_air_warfare_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, winged beings understood the significance of commanding the aerial domain in the theater of war. And as ages changes, so too must our methods evolve to secure this crucial advantage."
  BAR_friend_light_planes_desc:0 "Much akin to the griffon soaring aloft, the machine designed to dominate the sky must possess swiftness and agility as its foremost attributes."
  BAR_friend_tac_bomber_desc:0 "To hold dominance over the sky is but a part of the equation, the capacity to project power from it is a different matter that warrants our attention."
  BAR_friend_air_accidents_prevention_desc:0 "The skies above Barrad are fraught with perilous magical anomalies. It behooves us to provide our pilots with the necessary training to navigate such treacherous enviroment."
  BAR_friend_plane_factories_desc:0 "To secure aerial supremacy over the battlefield, we must establish specialized factories solely dedicated to the production of new aircraft."
  BAR_friend_alone_against_the_world_desc:0 "The situation is rather grim, from all sides there are enemies and there is no hope for reason. All we can do is to prepare our land the best we can for incoming storm."
  BAR_friend_capital_of_three_nations_desc:0 "Thought the blood we spit we now need to take care of not only lands Ambrosius claimed for his own but also those we aquired after that."
  BAR_friend_rejoin_rivelands_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we need to estabilish diplomatic ties with Riverland countries, unless we want to still be pariahs."
  BAR_friend_court_and_princess_desc:0 "Having lost her crown does not mean White Star lost all her connections and knowledge she gathered thought her years as queen. Now she will use them to help her brother instead."
  BAR_friend_riverlands_protectors_desc:0 "Few would guess that not only Ambrosius and former queen White Star would get along so well, but also that she will value Gąsienica's advice as much as his former master. That trio came up with one conclusion, safety of Rivelands is safety of Wittenland and it must be protected - even if it means they need to strike first."
  BAR_friend_evi_valley_stabilization_desc:0 "The well-known tensions between Wittenland and the griffons in the west combined with constant unrest in their lands forces us to act, we can't let the their revolutions spread to Rivelands. And while White Star and Silver Star don't agree on exact solution it seems that military intevention pushed by his sister and Gąsienica is safest bet." 
  BAR_friend_global_intervention_desc:0 "While direct military operation in far away lands is not quite in our best interest, princess White Star belives that we should attempt to help every potential friend and ally across the globe."
  BAR_friend_secure_gyphus_sea_access_desc:0 "There are two reasons for Gryphus Sea to be of our strategic interest. One presented by Gąsienica - safety of costal cities in Evi Valley. Second much more important according to Ambrosius - safety of the trade in the region. Princes White Star agrees with both of them."


  BAR_friend_white_star_is_helping_tooltip:0 "White Star is here to help her brother."
  BAR_fix_the_climate_tooltip:0 "Effects of Barrad climate will be less severe."


  BAR_friend_invite_advisors:0 "Invite Foreign Industrialists"
  BAR_friend_invite_advisors_desc:0 "Wittenland may yet be great, but first it needs to rely on a helping hoof from our kin. [RCT.GetName] and [LCT.GetName] are farther ahead in industrial development, and this is evident by their growing wealth, population and production. Distasteful as we may be of foreign influences, we have little choice but to invite several captains of industry to help modernise Wittenland. For a price, of course."
  BAR_friend_hire_diamond_dogs:0 "Hire Diamond Dog Miners"
  BAR_friend_hire_diamond_dogs_desc:0 "The Diamond Dogs to the north are a brutish race, yet even beasts have their uses. They are experts without peer in excavation, and given their relatively undereducated standards, we can even pay them less than we would our earth ponies. A small price for uncovering the vast mineral wealth we possess, which is crucial for our further development."
  BAR_friend_ivanhorn_dam:0 "Build The Ivanhorn Dam"
  BAR_friend_ivanhorn_dam_desc:0 "The river near Ivanhorn is in a suitable position for the construction of a modern dam, which will provide new jobs and energy, but also fresh water for domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes. Cooperation with Lakeish engineers will be required, as we cannot manage this project on our own entirely, but the benefits more than make up for it. The ecological effect is also estimated to be minimal."
  BAR_friend_railway_tunnels:0 "Excavate Road Tunnels"
  BAR_friend_railway_tunnels_desc:0 "The mountains we call home, the same ones we worship, present a barrier towards connecting our nation. Although it is certainly possible to use winding roads crossing mountain passes, such paths are very inefficient. By simply digging our way through the rock with shovels and explosives we can make more easily traversable and direct pathways. Diamond dog miners will accomplish the task with ease."
  BAR_friend_food_problem:0 "The Food Problem"
  BAR_friend_food_problem_desc:0 "As population grows, so does the need for more produce. Wittenland itself is sparse on suitable land, however. While the simple solution would be to increase food imports, it would be costlier in the long run and subject to the whims of our trading partners. Alternatively, we could expand traditional Wittenlandic terrace farms, which would be time consuming, yet effective. The choice is on [WIT.GetLeader]."
  BAR_friend_industrial_light_and_magic:0 "Industrial Light And Magic"
  BAR_friend_industrial_light_and_magic_desc:0 "The arcane is omnipractical and can be adapted to any purpose. One such possibility is to use magic in our industrial centres to enchant tools and production lines - a griffon technique admittedly, but its efficiency cannot be denied. We must utilise our strengths to push forwards to a bright future."
  BAR_friend_import_rijekan_machinery:0 "Import Rijekan Machinery"
  BAR_friend_import_rijekan_machinery_desc:0 "Because of their secure location, [RCT.GetName] were able to devote extensive resources towards industrialisation and electrification. As such, they're one of the most developed nations in the Riverlands, and it would be an insult to Wittenlandic pride if we couldn't keep up. We must strike a deal for their machinery, so that we can eventually engineer our own."
  BAR_friend_lakeish_arms_contract:0 "Contract With Lakeish Arms Companies"
  BAR_friend_lakeish_arms_contract_desc:0 "Lake City has been on the frontline against many griffon incursions - the hated knightly orders have attempted many times to murder and disperse innocent ponies. Thus they were forced to keep improving and manufacturing new firearm designs, to counter the dense armour of griffon knights. Perhaps some of their arms companies would be willing to work with our gunsmiths, in exchange for payment?"
  BAR_friend_nationwide_electrification:0 "Nationwide Electrification"
  BAR_friend_nationwide_electrification_desc:0 "Electricity is the light of the future. It can run almost indefinitely, as long as there's a power source, and doesn't rely on a unicorn to relight a torch. If the entire state could be connected by an electrical grid, all aspects of society would be drastically improved, as long as everypony is taught on proper care and maintenance."

  BAR_friend_small_business_subsidies:0 "Subsidize Small Businesses"
  BAR_friend_small_business_subsidies_desc:0 "While large companies are important, we shouldn't forget about the common ponies and their own minor businesses. On their own they may be insignificant, but their vast number makes them vital to our economy. By supporting the middle-class and their enterprises we can encourage quick growth and development. Perhaps some of these tiny companies will one day grow into major ones."
  BAR_friend_invite_eqs_scientists:0 "Invite Equestrian Scholars"
  BAR_friend_invite_eqs_scientists_desc:0 "Our cousins across the sea are at the forefront of scientific research and education. With our harmonic-leaning principles, it'd be easy to convince some of their gifted scientists to come to our country and aid us in our own projects. Let this be the beginning of a friendly and trusting relationship between Wittenlandic and Equestrian ponies!"
  BAR_friend_state_capitalism:0 "State Capitalism"
  BAR_friend_state_capitalism_desc:0 "Unrestrained capitalism is known to cause rampant inequality, yet a fully state-managed economy is known to be terribly inefficient and prone to corruption. State capitalism is in the middle ground. It refers to an economy dominated by state-owned companies with the government directing investment through wealth funds. Queen White Star is in favour of adopting such a system of "guided capitalism"."
  BAR_friend_highmane_wittenburgh_rail:0 "Build The High Mane-Wittenburgh Railway"
  BAR_friend_highmane_wittenburgh_rail_desc:0 "Rivers have traditionally been used to traverse Wittenland's valleys, but they are far from ideal. Our country is very mountainous and the passages between the peaks are difficult to travel through, even more so during winter. As such, there is no direct route between eastern and western Wittenland. To remedy this, Her Majesty is planning a long railway between the capital and her home town, High Mane."
  BAR_friend_national_mining_company:0 "Establish The Royal Mining Company"
  BAR_friend_national_mining_company_desc:0 "The mines in Wittenland have traditionally been owned by the nobility or the monarchy, and sometimes private corporations. Now Her Majesty wishes to bring all strategically important mines under the control of the government-owned Royal Mining Company, which will direct excavation operations far more efficiently than the nobles ever did."

  BAR_asinti_hospitals_1_desc:0 "Among our brothers and sisters, there are many talented alchemists; with their help, we can assist more wounded with less personnel. This news will delight the Master.""
  BAR_asinti_hospitals_2_desc:0 "Many of us have noticed that despite our best intentions, our hospitals are extremely inefficient. By eliminating unnecessary things like painkillers or protective equipment, we could serve even more wounded at a lower cost."
  BAR_asinti_hospitals_3_desc:0 "Helping the weak is a great virtue. But our medics do not always have the wounded under their care. In their free time, they could assist those who are fighting – by equipping medical points with artillery, we will support the efforts of our humble warriors."
  BAR_poverty_ascetism_desc:0 "Living in luxury is a simple path to evil; how can one possess more than another without exploiting them? Under the word of the Master, we are all equal, and all excess can be used in spreading liberation."
  BAR_literacy_indoctrination_desc:0 "The word is a powerful tool, carrying the magic of creation. But like everything in this world, it can be used for evil purposes. Our Master cannot allow our minds to be enslaved by the words of evil."
  BAR_grand_sanctuary_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters need a place where they can contemplate the sacred word of the Master. We know He will be pleased when we create a monument to our faith."
  BAR_capital_temple_0_desc:0 "We arose from nothing, but we will not return to nothingness. Despite having no solid foundations, we will build a small temple from the resources available to us."
  BAR_capital_temple_1_desc:0 "Before Barrad was enlightened by the truth of liberation, our Master began building a great temple. Unfortunately, there is little more than the foundations, so we will complete it in a modest style to remember that our faith does not rely on luxury."
  BAR_capital_temple_2_desc:0 "The Master devoted much time to building a temple that was never completed. Of course, he had reasons not to finish it at that time, but now we can complete his work. To the glory of liberation."
  BAR_capital_temple_3_desc:0 "The great temple has caught the eyes of our brothers and sisters since the Master completed its construction. Until now, it has not been fully utilized; we must change that. From today, it will be a monument to our faith that surpasses the palaces of emperors and princesses."
  BAR_blood_rituals_desc:0 "There was a rumor among our brothers and sisters that after the summoning ritual, the Master seemed troubled. Fortunately, today he put those rumors to rest by announcing great news. The path to freedom will be paved with the blood of the unbelievers; we must gather enough to ensure the next ritual brings us liberation."
  BAR_asinti_new_economy_desc:0 "With the new mission given to us by the Master, we must restructure the economy of our community. We must limit ourselves to only what is critically necessary for survival; everything else must be offered on the altar of war. For liberation."
  BAR_asinti_new_conscription_desc:0 "Our faith requires us to go to war. Every brother and sister understands this; we just need to organize them."
  BAR_blood_for_better_future_desc:0 "The sins of this world will be washed away in the blood of the wicked and the unbelievers. To the glory of ultimate liberation."
  BAR_asinti_attack_kasa_desc:0 "Many once called this place home, offering us shelter and aid. Now we offer them liberation."
  BAR_asinti_core_kasa_desc:0 "Not everyone understands that we offer liberation; fortunately, we know very well how to convince those who doubt."
  BAR_asinti_attack_wittenland_desc:0 "Kings, queens, and other crowned heads are nothing more than symbols of exploitation and enslavement. For the nobly born, the only chance to be equal with their subjects is death; we will bring them this mercy."
  BAR_asinti_core_wittenland_desc:0 "Ponies of Wittenland rejoice! You are one step closer to liberation, abadon false promises of you gods and join our cause!"
  BAR_asinti_attack_olv_desc:0 "The deer on the other side of the river are like a thorn in our side. They are just waiting for us to look away to thrust a treacherous dagger into our side, preventing us from achieving liberation. We cannot allow this."
  BAR_asinti_core_olv_desc:0 "As is usually the case, it turns out that upon closer acquaintance, our former enemies are merely blinded by false truths. Since the Master has commanded us to bring goodness to the world, we will share with them the vision of liberation."
  BAR_asinti_attack_gryphus_desc:0 "Gryphus is an extremely sad case, oppressed for years by the order and exploited by the rich. Many of our feathered brothers and sisters have begged the Master to liberate their kin, and today he has given us that command."
  BAR_asinti_core_gryphus_desc:0 "The Master's word has fallen on extremely fertile ground; griffons, one after another, are joining our ranks. Souls rejoice when so many can see the light of truth."
  BAR_asinti_attack_riverlands_desc:0 "The Master has commanded us to obtain the blood that will free the world from slavery. We will never be more ready for this task than now. It is time to set out."
  BAR_asinti_second_grand_ritual_desc:0 "We did it! The Master announced that we have shed enough blood to perform the ritual that will liberate us forever! Our mission is coming to an end, and future generations will sing hymns in praise of our deed."
  BAR_asinti_where_it_all_began_desc:0 "Not everyone understands what happened during the liberation ritual... but it doesn't matter, the Master will lead us to freedom. We will go wherever he directs."
  BAR_asinti_find_exact_place_desc:0 "The Master has tasked us with finding an ancient temple. Unfortunately, he is not sure of its location, as he last visited it as a young slave. No matter, wherever it is and whoever stands in our way – His will shall be fulfilled."
  BAR_asinti_get_jumpoints_desc:0 "To reach our goal, we will need to take control of the islands in the ocean. Their inhabitants will welcome us as the liberators we will become."
  BAR_asinti_source_of_power_desc:0 "We did it! We found the temple the Master was looking for! Now we just have to wait for him to finish exploring it and we for sure will hear good news from him!"
  BAR_asinti_industry_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters working in the factories are performing extremely important and necessary work. We must do everything in our power to ease their burden."
  BAR_asinti_industry_2_desc:0 "The world we live in is permeated with evil, and we are surrounded by enemies on all sides. Our community has a duty to protect itself from enslavement."
  BAR_asinti_industry_3_desc:0 "It is unacceptable in our community for someone to have more while another has less. Through collective effort, we must level the playing field for everyone for the common good."
  BAR_asinti_industry_4_desc:0 "Barrad is very rich in various types of building stone. For centuries it has been used to build fortresses and palaces; now we will use it for homes and temples!"
  BAR_asinti_industry_5_desc:0 "What is faith worth if we are not willing to defend it? What would freedom be if we were not willing to give our lives for it? How long would we remain enslaved if we were afraid to kill our oppressors?"
  BAR_asinti_industry_6_desc:0 "Inefficient factories must be expanded so that our faithful do not have to perform unnecessary work. For what is unnecessary work but slavery?"
  BAR_asinti_industry_7_desc:0 "Every brother and sister must be guaranteed a place to sleep, food, and clothing. There is no reason in this world why we cannot free them from the shackles of their basic needs."
  BAR_asinti_industry_10_desc:0 "We cannot stop at what we have right now; we must continually strive to improve the production of everything our community needs. For the liberation."
  BAR_asinti_industry_11_desc:0 "To be able to match our enemies, we need weapons for our warriors. To meet these needs, we will build more factories. Let the despots tremble at every step of our forces."
  BAR_asinti_industry_12_desc:0 "An armed hand will never be shackled. We will provide weapons for every faithful, for liberation."
  BAR_asinti_industry_14_desc:0 "In our beautiful community, following the words of the Master, we focus on what is needed by the community. There is no room for private projects or discoveries; everything we engage in must serve our ultimate liberation."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_desc:0 "We have gained access to the coastline; now, to protect the faithful there, we need a fleet."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_1_desc:0 "Few of us are knowledgeable about designing ships, let alone warships. But there is no problem that faith in the word of our Master cannot solve."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_2_desc:0 "The ocean is vast, and our forces on it are too small; there is only one solution – mobilization for the construction of new ships."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_3_desc:0 "Our Master has announced that through a ritual, we will be able to summon a powerful ally on the ocean waters. Blessed be his wisdom, which will guide us through the waves to liberation."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_4_desc:0 "The needs of our fleet are constantly growing, but our goal requires sacrifices; each new ship is one more barrier for our enemies."
  BAR_asinti_fleet_5_desc:0 "Our ships proudly await to bring eternal liberation to all creatures. However, it doesn't hurt to have more in reserve; as the Master said, forewarned is forearmed."

  barrad_first.1.d:0 "Deep in his study on a stormy night, Count Ambrosius paced in candlelight, dictating a letter to an enormous seated griffon. "Dear friend," began Ambrosius. "I extend to you an invitation to attend a great celebration. The most esteemed creatures of the land will be in attendance, and together we shall witness amazing wonders, the likes of which have never before been conceived!" Just saying the words made Ambrosius hop in excitement. "Come to my manor at once so that we may begin the festivities. Your friend, Count Ambrosius I." The griffon struggled to keep up with Ambrosius' words, scribbling as fast as he could onto a piece of parchment. "Oh this will be fun. So fun!" laughed Ambrosius.\n\nThe griffon finished writing and looked up to Ambrosius. "Who should receive this message?" The Count stood still, not acknowledging the question at all. "The Pentarchy?" asked the griffon.\n\n"Pentarchy. Pentarchy..." Ambrosius stared off into nothingness, trailing off for a moment. "Well, we simply must have Viira. Her extraordinary talents will help us greatly." Ambrosius tapped his chin. "And Leopold. To deny our party a mind like his would simply not do at all! He shall be there. Silver Star, on the other hoof..." The Count's face twisted in disgust. "Very rude guest. We could do without him. And... what was that old zebra's name again?"\n\nThe griffon unhooked a vial of liquid from around his neck and offered it to Ambrosius, who greedily took a swig. The Count blinked several times before glancing around the room. "Thank you, Gąsienica." He sighed and sunk into a chair. "Yes. Send it to the Pentarchy.""
  barrad_first.1.a:0 "We'll have a grand old time!"
  barrad_first.3.t:0 "Gathering the Nobles"
  barrad_first.3.d:0 "The Count gathered the rest of the Pentarchy in his manor. Expecting a party, they were surprised to hear the Count giving them an order: to gather the other nobles of the realm. The four begrudgingly accepted began to walk off, when, out of nowhere Cpt.Gąsienica offerred to do the job himself. The Pentarchy was surprised, but when they recollected, they gladly gave him the job."
  barrad_first.3.a:0 "Off to get this mess together."
  barrad_first.4.t:0 "The Feast"
  barrad_first.4.d:0 "The Count rose before the nobles and other Pentarchy members gathered in his manor. He began to speak, thanking them all for their presence. He gleefully told them of the great hunt that he had arranged. The nobles were ecstatic and pressed the Count to tell them more. He told them that there was much game in the woods, and that it was only increasing in number.\n\nHe then announced in a loud voice, "And so, dear friends, it is time to poach this game, in a grand hunt!" Speaking in a softer tone, he said, "But before the hunt can begin, we must first feast to prepare our spirits for such a spectacle. Today, you will see before you the most exquisite food and vintage drink that I could produce. Let us dine, then, to our health, and to glory!"\n\n"To glory!", exclaimed the nobles, who quickly set about to devouring the food brought before them, before downing it with copious amounts of wine and beer.\n\nAs the Count prepared to dine, Silver Star nervously asked to be excused. The Count reluctantly allowed him to go, before returning to his meal and mug."
  barrad_first.4.a:0 "A truly excellent feast!"
  barrad_first.5.t:0 "The Hunt"
  barrad_first.5.d:0 "The day after the feast, the Count rallied the hunters. He distributed high-grade weapons, produced in Leopold's forge, he then told them about the game they were to find. With all of the Pentarchy members arriving in the space of a few hours, the hunting party, numbering about a hundred members, set out from Ambrosius' manor. They began to trek into the woods, killing any lone adventurers and small bands they found, as well as a few unfortunate peasants. They went on for hours killing over a dozen ponies and griffons in the woods and putting their bodies in a wagon that Asinti ordered be dragged along with the party. Even Silver Star, in spite of his nervous disposition, was able to kill a few adventurers, for which he was lauded by his allies, especially Ambrosius.\n\nThe party had begun to turn back, when they heard a noise off to the side. The Pentarchy, along with a few dozen nobles went off to find out what the cause of it was, whilst the others guarded their bounty. When the expedition came to the source, they found a well-sized band of adventurers preparing to execute a small number of oddly dressed ponies. The expedition quickly cut down the adventurers and captured the robed ponies. They returned to the main party and continued back to the manor."
  barrad_first.5.a:0 "What a great bounty indeed!"
  barrad_first.51.t:0 "The Discovery"
  barrad_first.51.d:0 "After sorting out their bounty, and having yet another feast, most of the nobles retired to their own estates, and the peasants were set free. The Pentarchy quickly assembled to address the elephant in the room, the captured ponies. Asinti pleaded for them to be given to him, to which Viira responded, "Don't you have enough, doctor?" Ambrosius quickly silenced them before stating his own plan:\n\n"It is clear that we know very little about these strange ponies. I am dying to know more about them. I propose that we interrogate them, to find out who or even what they are."\n\nThe other Pentarchy members nodded in agreement. The ponies were briefly interrogated, before they offered to show the magistrates their meeting place. The ponies showed the Pentarchy into a cave containing all sorts of mysterious inscriptions. It was rightfully assumed that these were members of some sort of ancient cult. The last thing the cultists presented was a series of runes that looked like instruction for some kind of device. The type of device was completely beyond the Pentarchy members, and even the cultists had little knowledge of it. Sated with this knowledge, the Pentarchy split up, with Silver Star racing back to his tower, Asinti and Viira engaging in a lengthy argument, Leopold trying to figure out how the device worked, and Ambrosius drinking a few pints of ale, before passing out on his throne."
  barrad_first.51.a:0 "How... interesting."
  barrad_first.6.t:0 "Finding Silver"
  barrad_first.6.d:0 "After scouring through half of Elysium looking for him, Leopold got the brilliant idea to search Silver Star's tower. Upon reaching the tower, they were interrogated at length about their intentions. Half an hour later, they were let in. They entered the mage's room, only to find it empty. The two groaned and turned around to leave. They were walking past the large closet in the room when Asinti heard something.\n\n"Did you hear that scratching, Leopold? It sounded like it was coming from the closet. Surely he wouldn't"...\n\n"Where else would he possibly go?"\n\n"The bathroom, like any other sensible creature."\n\nAsinti burst the closet wide open to reveal a whimpering and petrified Silver Star. Silver fell out like a piece of timber, with Leopold barely breaking his fall. He set the unicorn down on the floor gently, and then walked over to Asinti.\n\n"How are we going to convince him to come with us?"\n\n"Don't worry, I've got this under control."\n\nAsinti proceeded to make loud sounds at Silver, telling him about a terrifying band of cossacks in the woods that they were about to hunt and that the Count wanted Silver to lead the party. Leopold, witnessing Silver's increasing fear, pushed Asinti aside, and began to reassure Silver that there were no cossacks and that the Count only wanted to see him. Silver slowly got up and left with them, though very timidly. Asinti and Leopold followed, and the griffon loudly scolded Asinti for his poor behavior."
  barrad_first.6.a:0 "Silver Star will remember that."  
  barrad_first.7.t:0 "Talks at Camp"
  barrad_first.7.d:0 "    "I still can’t fathom how you two tree huggers enjoy sitting in the forest so much," Leopold grumbled, aggressively sipping his tea. "Everything stinks, and no matter where you fly, there’s a branch or bush just waiting to scratch you. And worst of all," he spread his wings, revealing a leaf stuck between his feathers, "these damned things! I can’t remember the last time I had to preen myself this often."\n    Viira giggled, resting her head on one of her hooves. "If things getting caught in your feathers bothers you so much, I could help with that. You’d look rather amusing without them."\n    Leopold hunched, his posture suddenly aggressive, as if ready to pounce. "Don’t you even think about it."\n    "Just like foals," Asinti remarked, sipping his tea calmly. "You should take this opportunity to get to know each other better. It’s a shame we haven’t had the chance to meet like this before."\n    "I was busy with more important matters," Viira responded nonchalantly.\n    Asinti’s gaze drifted into the darkness beyond their camp. "I’m sure you were, but before you tell us more - it seems our last companion is finally joining us."\n    Viira followed Asinti’s gaze, her eyes narrowing with a sly grin. "You’re a bit early with that," she said, drawing out her words. "He’ll make his entrance in about... now."\n    Suddenly, the night was illuminated by a flash of bright magical light, which vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Silver Star came running from the direction of the light, skidding to a halt in front of the campfire where the others were gathered.\n    "It was a squirrel," Viira said, handing him a cup of water.\n    Silver Star stared at the cup but didn’t take it. "What are you talking about?" he asked, puzzled.\n    "The thing you just obliterated in the bush," Viira replied, taking a sip from her own cup. "It was a squirrel. Key word—was."\n    Silver Star looked at her, confused and a little frightened. Something about her eyes seemed off, but he couldn’t quite place it. Before he could dwell on it, Asinti’s voice cut through the night. "My dear Silver Star," the zebra began, "I want to extend my deepest apologies for my behavior at your house earlier. Some part of me couldn’t resist making that joke." He dipped his head slightly in a gesture of remorse.\n    "It’s... alright, I guess," Silver Star replied, still unsure.\n    Leopold was ruffling his feathers again, trying to dislodge whatever was stuck. "Tell me, boy," he began, "do you enjoy the scenery here?"\n    "Yes, it’s quite nice," Silver Star said, glancing around. "Especially at night. There’s something... exciting about it." He levitated a stool with his magic and sat down. "I don’t really know how to explain it."\n    Viira burst into laughter. "Did you really think he’d say he prefers cities and stone walls, featherbrain?"\n    Leopold’s crystal eye twitched slightly. "Are you going to pretend you saw that in some sort of vision too?" he shot back.\n    "That was actually quite easy to guess, my griffon friend," Asinti interjected smoothly. "Every powerful mage feels more at ease among the magic of the world." Sensing Leopold’s retort coming, he quickly added, "Since there are four of us here, what do you say to a card game?""
  barrad_first.7.a:0 "Of course!"
  barrad_first.8.t:0 "Hilltop Adventure"
  barrad_first.8.d:0 "    On the rolling hills of Barrad, a towering rock formation broke the earth’s surface, its rugged exterior dotted with patches of moss and lichen. Viira and Silver Star stood side by side at its base, staring up at the daunting climb that awaited them.\n    Viira looked at the unicorn. "Come on, don’t tell me you’re scared of a heights," she tried to poke him with her hoof but he moved away just as she was about to touch him.\n    Silver Star gazed at the giant stone wall in front of him. "No! I'm just... being thinking about most optimal path to the top," he replied.\n    "Weird way of spelling terrified. But I guess that’s just you," she said as she began to climb.\n    This whole idea filled him with dread. But his curiosity about the magical anomaly Viira told him about was somehow stronger. He took a deep breath and placed hoof on the first ledge\n    "Are you coming or not?" Viira’s shouted from above.\n    Hearing her mocking tone Silver Star began to climb. Each his move was calculated but shaky, as the vision of him falling down was getting more real with each climbed meter. Around halfway up, his hoof slipped, "Viira, wait!" he called while hugging to the stone wall.\n    She stopped for a moment and looked down at him. "What’s the matter? Afraid of heights?" she smirked.\n    Silver Star took a deep breath and continued the climb, trying to focus on the what is above him, not below. Then finally, after what felt like an eternity, he reached the summit, panting and exhausted.\n    Viira was already there, her gaze sweeping across the hills below. Hearing he also made it to the top she looked at him with a smirk. "Tell me... Couldn’t you just teleport here? Thought powerful unicorns do it all the time."\n    Still catching his breath, Silver Star replied, "I don’t trust it." But before he could explain why teleportation magic is not to be trusted, his eyes spotted what they had climbed here to see - a shimmering glow emanating from a small crack in middle of the rock the were on. It pulsed with energy, casting strange and shifting patterns in the air above it.\n    "It's... beautiful," Silver Star whispered.\n    "It is," Viira turned to him, her eyes narrowed. "And now, you’re going to help me figure out where this magic comes from.""

  barrad_second.1.t:0 "Tension at the Table"
  barrad_second.1.d:0 "    In the study of Count Ambrosius, the other four members of the Pentarchy sat around a large wooden table strewn with papers and various notes. Asinti moved his hooves methodically over the strange schematics they had acquired from the defeated cultists. Leopold and Viira were discussing the possible meaning of them, their voices low and intense.\n    Silver Star, however, seemed detached from the discussion. He sat a bit away from the table, his sketchbook open and pencil floating in the air. His focus was entirely on the drawings he was making, the conversation drifting over his head like a distant breeze.\n    Leopold noticed his lack of attention. "Silver Star, are you even listening?" he asked sharply.\n    "Yeah, yeah, I'm listening." Silver Star mumbled, barely looking up.\n    "No, you're not. This might be something revolutionary," said Leopold, flying closer to him. "What are you even drawing that's so important?"\n    Silver Star shifted uncomfortably, closing his sketchbook slightly. "It's nothing. Just... something to pass the time."\n    Leopold's patience ran out. His wings spread as he leaned in. "Pass the time? Who do you think you are, Silver Star!?" He reached out and tried to grab the sketchbook from him.\n    Silver Star's reaction was immediate. "Don't touch that!" he yelled, pulling the sketchbook away and holding it protectively against his chest. His eyes were wide with fear and anger.\n    The room fell silent. Asinti and Viira paused their discussion, turning to watch the unfolding drama.\n    Leopold looked at him with anger. "What's your problem? We're trying to crack a magical mystery here, and you're doodling like a foal!" He frowned.\n    Silver Star's voice shook as he responded, "Trying is a good word. I just got bored of listening to three ponies... or whatever who don’t know what they're talking about."\n    Viira, sensing the imminent catastrophe, stepped in. "Leopold, maybe we should just let him be."\n    Leopold looked like he was about to explode. "Fine...” he said through closed beak.\n    Silver Star didn't respond, his grip on the sketchbook tightening. Asinti, who had been quietly observing, finally spoke up, his voice calm and measured. "Silver Star, if the topic is so boring for you, maybe you can enlighten us on what you found."\n    Silver Star nodded slightly. “It’s a... how do you call it, ah yes, blueprint. If I’m right, and I’m quite sure I am, it shows some sort of magic-infusing reactor.” He leaned over the table to point at one of the parchments. “Here, you see? This crystal device will react with magical energy in the closest environment...”"

  barrad_second.2.d:0 "As morning sunlight filtered in through clouded windows, Count Ambrosius emerged from his bedchamber and stretched. Standing guard by the entrance, Gąsienica was ready to greet him. "Feeling better, sir?"\n\n"Yes, incredibly!" Ambrosius laughed and slapped Gąsienica's back. "You know, it's been so dull around here lately." He began trotting through the halls of the manor with Gąsienica keeping pace at his side. "But that party was invigorating. Hunting! Killing! Mystery! So much excitement..." Ambrosius stroked his beard in contemplation. "I know what we must do: throw another party, bigger and grander." The Count was positively giddy by the time he entered the throne room.\n\n"More drinking, more feasting, more merriment!" Ambrosius was smiling just imagining the festivities. "Begin preparations at once! Send out invitations to the Pentarchy, and all the nobles." He slowly turned to face Gąsienica, his smile remaining but his eyes becoming dark. "And make sure our guests know that refusing to attend will have severe consequences.""

  barrad_second.3.d:0 ""You've never- Unbelievable! You simply must witness it," Ambrosius implored the group of nobles around him, before turning to wave across the hall. "Viira, care to entertain our guests?" he shouted. The doe sighed, and began to walk toward the balcony. Ambrosius galloped to join her and beckoned for the group to follow. From the manor's balcony the two looked over a nearby village, as well as the untamed forests and mountains in the distance. Ambrosius pointed to the village watchtower. "There, that's a good spot."\n\nViira focused intensely before closing her eyes. A strange energy could be felt in the air around her, and the seer's robes began to ripple with magical power. Suddenly, a large section of the village surrounding the tower became shrouded in a dark fog. When the fog dissipated, everything that had been inside it was gone. "Spectacular!" shouted one of the guests, as the rest of them mumbled in amazement. "Where did it all go?" asked another.\n\nViira smirked. "A magician never reveals her secrets.""

"Did you devise these plans?" asked Viira, showing the instructions for the strange device.\n\n"No, they come from the master." answered the acolyte.\n\n"Master?"\n\n"You think Count Ambrosius is the master of Barrad? No, the true master lies hidden from the unworthy and undiscerning. It is our purpose to serve It, for we have done so for countless generations." The acolyte lowered her head. "But we have failed. It has become angered by the greed and cruelty of the land, and unleashed the plagues that afflict Barrad. It is the cause of all our suffering.""
  barrad_second.4.a:0 "How curious."
  barrad_second.5.t:0 "Out of the Dark, Into the Night"
  barrad_second.5.d:0 ""Who is the master?" asked Viira, once again in a cellar surrounded by shadowy figures.\n\n"It is the Great Machine, and we are Its servants." The hooded acolyte looked up and raised her hooves, prompting the rest of the cultists to follow suit.\n\n"What does this machine want?" Viira's mind raced with questions. "Can I meet it?"\n\n"Only a privileged few can discern Its will, much less stand in Its presence. We are but the Outer Circle, and I have told you all that I can. If you wish to know more you must contact the Inner Circle."\n\n"I see." Viira bowed humbly.\n\n"When you are ready, seek them out." The acolyte held up a hoof. "But be prepared to prove yourself. Only those worthy are allowed to know the secrets they hold.""
  barrad_second.5.a:0 "A machine?"
  barrad_second.6.t:0 "Descent"
  barrad_second.6.d:0 "Deep into the night, Viira sat studying the codex, looking closely at its inscriptions and comparing them to every ancient script she had samples of. She sighed in frustration, yet another dead end. The runes were alien, but at the same time they seemed so familiar. There was still a missing piece to the puzzle. She needed answers, and so she took the codex and journeyed through the woods to return to the cave. At the entrance, she saw a solitary pony emerging from its depths. "What were you doing in there?" asked Viira.\n\nThe pony stopped in his tracks. "Just exploring," he answered. Viira examined him closely, there was something odd about him. He wore strangely fine clothes, and didn't seem very comfortable in the natural environment.\n\n"Anything inside?" asked Viira. The pony shook his head, agitated. "Is that so? Because I believe I've met some of your friends who would disagree." Viira took out the codex and showed it to the pony, whose eyes went wide in realisation. He became tense, silently staring at Viira. "Please, I mean you no harm. I just want to understand!" she pleaded.\n\nThe pony scrutinised her for a long moment, before sighing. "We will be in touch. If you prove your intentions, you will find your answers." He trotted off into the forest without saying another word."

  barrad_second.7.d:0 "    Leopold leaned over the table, his one good eye gleaming as his talon traced the lines of the blueprints. The crystal in his other eye socket pulsed with intensity, and his feathers puffed in excitement as he pointed to several details on the paper.\n    “This machine,” Leopold began, his voice rising, “is a marvel! These connections here, they channel energy directly from the environment into the core. No waste, no need for refueling! It’s efficient, revolutionary, and...”\n    Viira waved her hoof. "Yes, yes, it’s impressive, Leopold. But it doesn't take two pairs of eyes to see that it relies on unstable crystals. It’s amateur work, but that’s why you have me." She smirked.\n    Leopold’s feathers fluffed like he was about to fight. "Amateur?" he repeated. "Do you even know what are you talking about? The precision in..."\n    "We get it, it’s almost as great as spring soldiers fillies love to play with," Viira chuckled. "Or in this case chicks."\n    Leopold slammed his talons on the table, causing Silver Star to flinch and shrink into his chair, not daring to make a sound.\n    Asinti, watching with mild amusement, leaned his head on one hoof, unfazed by the tension. He glanced at the blueprints, humming quietly, seemingly talking to someone unseen. After a moment of silence, Asinti spoke. "Silver Star," he smiled faintly, "care to show us what you are working on right now with your pencil?\n    Leopold glared at the unicorn. "If it's that sketchbook again..."\n    "Maybe he’ll redraw this in a way we can read it, unlike you," Viira smirked.\n    Leopold opened his beak to retort, but Asinti’s laughter quickly prevented it. "Maybe before reigniting your argument at least look at what our friend here did."\n    "Uh... yes... I mean no... I mean..." Silver Star, was nervously shifting in his seat. His voice was barely a whisper.\n    Viira raised an eyebrow. "Bit louder, not everycreature here has as young ears as me and you."\n    Silver Star felt all eyes on him. His hooves trembled as he tried to speak. “I... um...” His voice faltered, nerves overtaking him. Then, in a burst, he tossed his sketchbook onto the table. “I think you’re both wrong,” he said quickly, the words flying out.\n    Viira narrowed her eyes and quickly said, "Give me that." while grabbing the sketchbook. She scanned the pages for a moment. “There might be merit here,” she said after a pause. “Look, Leopold.” She pointed to corresponding elements on both sets of blueprints.\n    Asinti leaned back, satisfied. "Amazing what happens when you stop arguing and listen to the quiet ones.""

  barrad_second.8.d:0 "    Asinti and Leopold found themselves in a library deep within Ambrosius' manor. The room was vast and cavernous, with towering shelves crammed with books and scrolls. With each flap of Leopold's wings, the air grew dustier and dustier.\n    "Could you stop that?" Asinti coughed, waving a hoof to clear the air.\n    Looking down upon the zebra on the floor Lepold flapped his wings even faster. "I don't think I can," he said, adding after a moment, "And why exactly are you so interested in the geology of these lands all of a sudden?"\n    "Do I need a reason?" Asinti replied.\n    Leopold fluffed his feathers and tried to mimic Asinti's voice, "Do I need a reason?" Then with his own voice, he added, "Everything has a reason. I, for one, want to build a mine..." His sentence was abruptly interrupted as he crashed into a bookshelf. The impact sent the griffon and several books crashing to the floor, creating a giant cloud of dust that billowed through the room.\n    Seeing this, Asinti couldn't help but laugh. "Where's the reason in hitting the shelf, then?"\n    Leopold sprang to his paws, ripping the seams of his suit in the process. "You think it's funny?" he screamed, his breath heavy. "I'll show you something funny," he added, grabbing a book from the floor and hurling it at Asinti. To his surprise, the zebra dodged it effortlessly. Enraged, Leopold began throwing every book and scroll within reach. Each one either missed or was skillfully avoided by Asinti.\n    "Wait," Asinti shouted, catching one of the flying books. "This might be what we're looking for." He examined the cover, it read 'Deep Drill Results 989' and was signed by Ambrosius himself. "Could have just looked at the covers, but at least you had some fun," he added.\n    Leopold, still breathing heavily, began to calm down. "I wasn't looking for a book, I was trying to hit you with one," he muttered.\n    "Then at least we've concluded that you're a better librarian than sportsgriff," Asinti put a small smile, opening the book.\n    Leopold felt that his talons instinctively extended. For a brief moment, he was both mentally and physically ready to cut the zebra's throat. But as quickly as the anger came, he managed to suppress it, taking a deep breath to steady himself."

  barrad_second.11.d:0 "    The grand ballroom in Ambrosius’ manor was a sight to behold, opulent and regal. In all the splendor there were only few places covered in shadows, in one of which stood Silver Star. His eyes on the center of the room where Viira danced gracefully among the guests, her laughter mingling with the music. His heart ached as he watched her. He wanted to approach her, to ask her for a dance, but every time he took a step forward, his courage failed him. The noise of the ballroom, the laughter, and the chatter all. It was so abstract, so outside, so... unknown.\n    With a sigh, Silver Star sat on the floor as the sounds of the ball continuing around him. He pulled out his sketchbook and pencil, seeking solace in the familiar acts, but even that seemed hollow tonight. As he sketched absentmindedly, his eyes kept drifting back to Viira. She was laughing now, her head thrown back in delight as she spun in the arms of some griffon Silver Star's chest tightened with a mix of longing and sadness. She was radiant and confident, while he felt small and insignificant.\n    He took his gaze away and stared down at his sketchbook, the lines on the paper blurring as tears welled up in his eyes. Surrounded by a sea of ponies yet more alone than ever. His heart and mind screamed with unspoken words, but just like the sun that was shining now and forever the ball continued not noticing his existence."

Curious, he walked toward it and found Silver Star, tears streaming down his face. Leopold crouched beside the unicorn.\n    "Hey, buddy," he said, cutting through the noise. "What's wrong?"\n    Silver Star wiped his eyes. "It's nothing," he muttered.\n    Leopold glanced at the dance floor and understood. He saw Viira laughing as she danced. "Kids these days," Leopold said with a laugh. “Why don’t you ask her for a dance?” He pointed toward the dance floor.\n    Silver Star shook his head, panic in his voice. "I can't. What if she... and then I... and everyone... and then she... and then... and then..." \n    "Listen”, Leopold interrupted, “if you ask, she might say yes, or you’ll go back to your corner. Which for sure gives bigger probability of something nice happening than sitting here.”.”\n    Silver Star hesitated, his heart pounding. He took a breath and stood, his legs trembling. Leopold put his claw on Silver Star’s back, sensing more excuses coming. “And if you don't do it now, I’ll drag you there myself.”\n    Silver Star paused, his heart racing. He took another breath and stood, his hooves shaking. "I don’t have a choice, do I?" \n    Leopold nodded.\n    Silver Star took a few steps toward the dance floor, his heart racing faster with each one. As he neared Viira, the world seemed to focus on him. Every eye in the room, even the music, seemed to wait. Just as he reached her, nerves took over. Panic surged. He turned and bolted to the balcony. Silver Star collapsed under the night sky, he buried his face in his hooves, feeling tears sting again."

"It's nothing," he muttered.\n    Asinti glanced at the dance floor and understood. He saw Viira laughing as she danced. "Has she said no?" Asinti placed his hoof on Silver Star’s back.\n    "I haven’t even asked," Silver Star replied.\n    Asinti smiled. "Then hope is not lost, my friend. Go and ask her to dance." Seeing Silver Star about to make excuses, Asinti took out a vial from his coat and handed it to him. "Here, this should help."\n    “What is it? A potion? I don’t sense any magic in it,” Silver Star said, examining the vial.\n    Asinti laughed. "Even better—booze. Be careful, it’s strong."\n    Silver Star hesitated, then took a big sip. The drink burned his throat like fire. Struggling to breathe, he stood up, his legs trembling. "Okay, I'll try."\n    Silver Star took a few steps toward the dance floor, his heart racing faster with each one. As he neared Viira, the world seemed to focus on him.

She stepped closer to see him better, "And now you are sitting on the floor... outside."\n    "It's... it's just the crowd. It's a bit overwhelming, that's all." Silver Star searched for an excuse, but even he didn't believe it.\n    Viira nodded but didn’t leave. She looked at him closely. "I saw you walking toward me before you left. Did you want something?"\n    Silver Star hesitated. He looked away, and after what felt like an hour, he finally said, "I... I wanted to ask you for a dance."\n    Viira stared at him, then exactly what he feared happened. She burst out laughing. His face flushed with embarrassment. He tried to hide his face behind his hooves, but before he could, Viira smiled.\n    "I’m more than happy to," she said.\n    Silver Star looked directly into her eyes. "Wait, Really?"\n    "Of course," Viira replied, stepping closer. "And if the crowd is too much, we can dance here."

  barrad_third.1.d:0 ""The time has come for us to address a matter of great importance." Count Ambrosius leaned forward and rummaged through the mountain of papers on his desk. Eventually, he grabbed a photograph and held it up to show Gąsienica.\n\n"This is an automobile. It is a means of transportation, but it is also common for wealthy and powerful individuals to keep them as status symbols," Ambrosius explained. "I must have one. Contact a manufacturer and entice them to come to Barrad. I will acquire one of their vehicles to style and craft into my own." He tapped his hooves together rapidly. "Oh, I can picture it now!"\n\n"Right away, sir." Gąsienica nodded, rising to leave. The Count paid him no mind, instead staying focused on scrutinising the photograph he had pulled out and mumbling about his planned modifications."
  barrad_third.1.a:0 "Make sure it can handle off-roading."
  barrad_third.2.t:0 "Curse of Prescience"
  barrad_third.2.d:0 "Gąsienica rushed through the halls of Count Ambrosius' manor, making a beeline for the throne room. Upon entering the room, he rocketed towards the lounging Count, presenting a loose collection of papers. "Sir, I have received word that a grave threat has emerged and is attacking the mountain villages!" he blurted out, before stopping to catch his breath.\n\n"Ah yes, those reports of mutant plants near the southwestern border. A truly bizarre situation." Ambrosius took the documents and leafed through them, lazily. "Many griffons down there... that's near where you grew up, isn't it?"\n\n"Yes," said Gąsienica. "Are we going to do anything to help them?" There was obvious concern in his voice.\n\n"No need to worry, I've sent a letter to the Pentarchy." Ambrosius waved a dismissive hoof. "They can handle it. Probably. Do you know how they're doing? Are they all still alive?" The Count blinked several times before shaking his head vigourously. "In any case, I have asked them to look into this matter and resolve it. They'll get around to it when they can, and then this threat will be wiped off the map!"\n\nGąsienica frowned in response."
  barrad_third.2.a:0 "That doesn't sound very promising..."
  barrad_third.22.t:0 "Gąsienica's Quest"
  barrad_third.22.d:0 "In his personal quarters, Gąsienica was drafting a letter of his own to supersede the one the Count had already sent out to the Pentarchy. It had to be done; the members of the Pentarchy had many priorities, but the safety of the mountain villagers was certainly not one of them. "It is my understanding that Count Ambrosius recently requested that you travel to the mountains in order to address reports of aggressive vegetation," Gąsienica began the letter.\n\n"Disregard those instructions, and do not concern yourself in any way with this matter. I will attend to it personally." Gąsienica's claw trembled as he thought of the hardships being endured by the border villagers. "Those griffons are my kin, and this is something I must do myself. Your faithful servant, Captain Gąsienica." Upon finishing the letter, he sighed and clasped his claws together. It was done. All that was left to do was send it out and begin his own journey into the mountains."

  barrad_third.3.d:0 "Deep in the hostile forests of Barrad, Viira entered the ancient halls of an unmarked compound. The air was damp and heavy as her guides—a pair of robed ponies—led her into a dark room deep in the bowels of the compound. She found herself surrounded by shadowed figures standing on a circular raised platform, observing her.\n\n"Wise ones, it is an honour to stand before you." Viira bowed. "I humbly ask for your aid in my research, for I have no doubt that you all are the key to securing our future." The cultists listened silently, before conferring among themselves.\n\n"You wish to know the secrets of the Inner Circle," one of the figures said. Viira couldn't tell which one. "Your reputation precedes you. But to know the nature of the gifts we protect, you first must prove your worth to us by completing the Trial.""

  barrad_third.4.d:0 ""Outsider, to prove yourself you must first complete the Trial of the Machine." A hooded acolyte presented a burning candle to Viira. "Take this. Travel through the caves, find the sacred lantern, and then return here. If the candle goes out, you fail the Trial, and then you will be lost."\n\nViira nodded, descending down the dark cave path to begin the Trial. She navigated the treacherous path for close to an hour with only the light of the candle to guide her, before at last coming upon a conspicuous alcove containing an ornate lantern. She took the lantern, placing the candle inside it, before making the long trek back to where she had started.\n\nUpon returning, the acolyte rejoiced at the sight of her. "It is complete!" He took the lantern with great reverence. "You walked the path of ignorance, guided by the light of knowledge, and with the protection of the Great Machine, returned to us so that you may pass this knowledge on to the next generation.""
  barrad_third.4.a:0 "So ends the Trial."
  barrad_third.5.t:0 "Shadow Play"
  barrad_third.5.d:0 ""May I enter?" Viira stood before an enormous door leading below the cult's compound, protected by several guards.\n\n"No," One of the guards—a unicorn—stated flatly. "Only the most senior among us are permitted to enter the abyssal chamber." The words contained hints of an Aquileian accent.\n\n"I see." Viira studied the unicorn closely. She seemed to be in charge of all the other guards. "You're not from around here, are you?"\n\n"That is true. I was... compelled to come here and abandon my natural history studies in Aquileia." The unicorn's eyes looked past Viira for a moment. "But it is here that I found my purpose, in the service of the Great Machine."\n\n"I have come a long way from my home, as well." Viira brought a hoof to her chest. "I hope that I may also find my purpose here."\n\n"That's all well and good, but you're still not getting in." said the unicorn, unimpressed. Viira nodded and walked away.\n\n"
  barrad_third.5.a:0 "Fair enough."
  barrad_third.6.t:0 "Splinters"
  barrad_third.6.d:0 "The air was thick and heavy as Viira wandered through a cavern deep beneath the lair of the Inner Circle. Hidden behind layers of oppressive darkness, she could just barely make out a series of bizarre silhouettes filling the cavern: the Old Machines. According to the cultists, they were gifts from the Great Machine to be worshiped and cared for, although when she pressed them they confessed not to know the original purpose of these strange creations.\n\nViira got close to one and examined it using the light of her torch. The "machine" was tall and intimidating, but also unlike anything she had ever seen before. Its lines and curves were aesthetically pleasing, seeming more the work of a sculptor than a mechanist. The texture was nothing like the machines of Leopold, it did not look metallic at all. Viira reached out a hoof to feel its surface and found it not as cold as she expected. It felt rubbery, so she pushed to test its firmness. And it groaned.\n\nThis thing was... alive? The surface shifted all on its own. Viira's blood went cold. There was no doubt. These machines had been grown, not built. Now aware that she was surrounded by organic beings, Viira was overcome by a feeling of unease. She felt like she was being watched, watched by something larger and more alien than anything she had previously imagined. Most of all, she felt afraid. Viira steeled herself. Now was not the time to turn back, not when confronted by such an opportunity for discovery. She needed to push forward."
  barrad_third.6.a:0 "Let's take a closer look..."
  barrad_third.61.t:0 "Intervention"
  barrad_third.61.d:0 "After a brief period of trial and error, Viira was able to successfully awaken the Old Machines using magical stimulus. The cultists were amazed and grateful to finally see the full potential of their mysterious gifts realised. Unfortunately, the machines proved too dangerous to study in much detail after being turned on. Regardless, the computational abilities of the strange constructs are now being put to use for the advancement of Barrad."
  barrad_third.61.a:0 "Fascinating!"
  barrad_third.62.t:0 "Observation"
  barrad_third.62.d:0 "After a brief period of deliberation, Viira decided to study the Old Machines closely while refraining from stimulating them any further. By making use of specialised equipment she was able to glance inside the strange constructs without harming them. In the end, she determined that the organic computers could not have been a natural occurrence, and must have been built by something. Additionally, the information she uncovered about their structure will be sure to advance our understanding of computing."

Universal truth remains out of reach.\n\nThey serve you. They keep you alive. But still you hunger.\n\nYou feel a jolt."
  barrad_third.7.a:0 "What does it mean?"
  barrad_third.8.t:0 "Journey of a Thousand Miles"
  barrad_third.8.d:0 "As he made the long and arduous trek over treacherous mountain paths, Gąsienica's mind was consumed by thoughts of his home. Distant memories from when he had lived there; memories of joy, innocence, and then the most intense fear. Back before he had been saved by Ambrosius... but now was not the time to dwell on that. Much more pressing was confronting the novel menace that threatened to destroy his kin.\n\nAfter emerging from a narrow pass, he at last laid eyes on his home village, only to see it besieged by an army of shambling trees. The villagers were mounting a stiff resistance, but clearly wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer. Gąsienica let loose a shout and charged towards the trees at full speed, slamming into them with all his weight and ferocity. Fighting using only his bare claws, he split trunks and ripped off branches with his incredible strength. The villagers were inspired by the show of bravery and pushed forward, cutting down the trees with their swords and axes.\n\nOne of the fighters chucked an improvised incendiary bomb into the cluster of trees, which exploded setting many ablaze. Frightened, the remaining trees ceased their attack and began to slowly retreat. "I said no fire!" a voice shouted. "Maniacs! Are you trying to burn the whole village down?" Griffons rushed to keep the flames under control, but the voice brought back memories for Gąsienica. It was a voice he had not heard in a lifetime."
  barrad_third.8.a:0 "Could it really be, after all these years?"
  barrad_third.81.t:0 "Find Your Way"
  barrad_third.81.d:0 "Gąsienica waded through the victorious militia to find an old friend from his childhood leading them. "Jánošík!" he shouted, raising his claws high. "I hope you've been staying out of trouble!" Jánošík laughed and pulled Gąsienica in for an embrace.\n\n"I try my best," Jánošík said with a grin, drawing a sceptical look from Gąsienica. "Sure, occasionally I liberate a noble passerby from their wealth, but I never keep it for myself. It all goes to the people who need it most." Jánošík had to tilt his head up to engage in the conversation, such was the degree to which Gąsienica towered over him. "Say, I remember you being big, but now you're built like a tank! What's your secret?" Gąsienica frowned, remembering the many experiments Ambrosius had performed on him to enhance his physical performance. In the awkward silence that followed, Jánošík nervously tugged at the ornate amulet around his neck.\n\n"What's that?" asked Gąsienica, noticing it for the first time. "I never pictured you being very fond of jewelry."\n\n"This? Erm... it's just a trinket. Sort of a good luck charm." Jánošík gave a sheepish smile. "Silly, I know."\n\nA sharp gust of wind blew a branch from one of the slain plants onto the ground between them. Gąsienica picked it up to give it a closer look. "That's strange. These leaves look like the kind I use to make the Count's medicine." He took one in his claw to feel its texture.\n\n"We'll have more time for botany later, but right now I think we just made them angry." Jánošík looked towards the horizon. "There will be more of those things coming soon, and we need to prepare.""

  barrad_third.82.d:0 ""Gather 'round, everyone!" Gąsienica shouted as he stood next to a pile of nondescript crates. "We're going to need all the firepower we can muster to beat back these monsters. Fortunately, I came prepared." He kicked open one of the crates to reveal its contents: dozens of shiny new magical rifles. "Grab one, and take up a defensive position around the village!" The townsfolk did as they were told, and soon formed a makeshift skirmish line facing the approaching enemy. The shambling trees were slow to advance, but were coming closer and closer by the minute.\n\nWhen they came within range, the villagers began firing, their magical projectiles proving highly effective against the plant monsters. At the same time, Gąsienica charged out ahead, using his claws to rip the trees apart with reckless abandon. Jánošík was right by his side, felling many trees with his axe.\n\nDuring the fierce fighting, Jánošík tripped and became tangled in the roots of the slain plants, and the trees around him converged to finish him off. In desperation, he ripped the amulet off his neck and held it out towards the encroaching monsters, closing his eyes in anticipation of the killing blow...\n\nBut the blow never came. Sensing the magic of the amulet, they dared not come any closer to it. As the plants remained still, shots from the villagers and Gąsienica's devastating strikes shredded them. It did not take much longer for the remaining trees to be broken. Gąsienica, Jánošík, and the entire village stood victorious."
  barrad_third.82.a:0 "Now that's what I call landscaping!"

  barrad_third.83.d:0 "After fighting off all the attacking trees, Gąsienica sat recovering with Jánošík in his home. "I think it's time you explained what's really going on with that amulet," said Gąsienica. Jánošík nodded.\n\n"In the past, you may have seen a group of robed idiots scurrying around Barrad, raving about their god, who lives somewhere underground," began Jánošík. "A merchant I know works with them, gathering magical artifacts and the like. It's all supposed to go to the cult, but sometimes they offer some of it up for sale, and this particular item caught my eye. It's said to be imbued with magic that can scare away anything born from the cult's god." He held up the amulet. "Anything that could scare a god sounded pretty interesting to me. Of course at the time I thought that was all nonsense... but maybe those cultists were on to something after all?"\n\n"You know, I've learned a bit of magic in my time around the Pentarchy." Gąsienica examined the amulet closely. "I believe we can use this artifact to cast a warding spell that will make sure those things don't come back." Jánošík was intrigued, and watched as Gąsienica channeled the item's power into a spell. He could feel the magical energy in the air, and from Gąsienica's smile he knew the spell had been a success.\n\nAfterwards, the two went off to save the other mountain villages that were threatened, defeating any plants attacking them and casting the warding spell. After all the other villages were protected, they parted ways, and Gąsienica began his long trek back to Count Ambrosius."

"Then the controls could..."\n    Viira reclined in her chair across the table, a small, satisfied smile on her lips. "Leopold," she said, grabbing papers nearly blown away by his wings. "Control yourself. A few more laps, and we’ll need to redraw everything."\n    Silver Star sat quietly. He had something important to contribute, but it was hard to interject when Leopold and Viira were in one of their moods. Asinti, as usual, let them hash it out. After a pause in the conversation, Silver Star cleared his throat. Cautiously, he reached into his satchel. "Uh, before we get too far with the construction," he said, pulling out a modest book, "I thought this might be useful. It’s... about magical safety. I wrote it last week."\n    Viira raised a brow, glancing at the book. "Magical safety?" she said, her tone amused. "You wrote a book?"\n    Silver Star blushed, nodding. "Y-Yeah. It’s about precautions with powerful spells."\n    Leopold, still hovering, paused to glance at the book. "Safety’s important," he nodded. "Burnt feathers regrow slowly."\n    Encouraged, Silver Star smiled nervously. He flipped the book open to the table of contents. "I tried to group it," he said. "But as non-unicorns, you might not understand everything at first glance. I can explain it."\n    A long, tense pause followed. Silver Star immediately realized his mistake. Viira’s eyes narrowed sharply. Her relaxed posture stiffened, and she straightened in her chair. "Non-unicorns?" she repeated, her voice like ice. "What wouldn’t we understand, Silver Star?"\n    Silver Star’s face reddened as panic set in. "I-I didn’t mean... I wasn’t talking about you or..."\n    Viira’s voice sliced through the room. "You were suggesting some of us aren’t as experienced with magic?"\n    Silver Star shook his head. "No! That’s not what I meant! Unicorns experience magic differently and I just thought..."\n    Viira leaned forward, locking eyes with him. "You thought what, exactly? That I’m not on your level?"\n    Asinti, chuckling softly, broke the tension. "This is more entertaining than I expected." His voice, oddly distant, carried an eerie tone. "But maybe we can put wounded egos aside?"\n    Viira stared at Silver Star, her gaze sharp. But slowly, the tension eased. She leaned back and crossed her hooves over her chest, exhaling."

  barrad_third.10.d:0 "High in the mountains, Viira walked through a field of mangled plants. The ground was littered with twisted trunks and branches scarred by deep cuts and magical blasts, the bodies of trees which had only recently threatened to wipe the mountain villages off the map. Viira took a sample from one of the plants, tucking it away inside her bag, before heading towards the nearby village. As she approached the town she could sense a strange magic in the air. She questioned the villagers about the spell, and they pointed her towards the griffon who had cast it.\n\nViira tracked down the griffon, who was named Jánošík, and eagerly shook his claw. "Greetings, I am Viira." She smiled. "And I must say, superb work dealing with those nasty plants! May I ask you a few questions about how you managed it?" Jánošík clearly recognised her and scowled, remaining silent. "Now I know you may not be fond of the Pentarchy, but any information you can provide will help me get to the bottom of this matter, and ensure such a tragedy never occurs again," pled Viira.\n\nJánošík sighed, moved by her sincerity. "All right," he said, leading Viira to the location where he kept an ornate amulet. "This is it." Jánošík offered the amulet for inspection. Viira held it up and flipped through her codex, comparing the symbols inside to those adorning the artifact.\n\n"Interesting..." she marveled."

The mad Count refused to abdicate, and battle was joined. Ambrosius and his minions were no match for the combined power of the four friends, however, and they were quickly defeated. As the four became close friends, they fully realized the depths of their wrongdoing. They appeared before the commoners of Barrad and apologized for their actions, admitting that their aims were misguided.\n\nThe peasants, however, did not care. When they realized the four had let their guard down and were within reach, they immediately descended upon them to enact their vengeance for decades of horror, abuse and slavery. An angry mob of hundreds of ponies armed with pitchforks and torches swarmed the magocrats and slew them one by one before they even realized what was happening. Thus, the Pentarchy came to a violent and sudden end.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events is sure to signal the beginning of a new era for Barrad, although only time will tell if it is to be a happy one."

  barrad_friends.1.d:0 "Viira always left Silver uneasy. That calm, collected deer held a smile that strained his calm; her eyes, seemingly docile, that kept a secret beneath. Profoundly unsettled, trying to converse with Viira was akin to chatting with a ravenous wolf behind its toothy grin.\n\nHowever, this sensation had recently changed. Before, Silver would've searched a way out of a situation involving Viira. He now found himself oddly at peace as the two of them shared the main table at the library, each diving deep into their tomes. The unicorn hadn't even noticed Viira, and when he did, there was no reflexive recoil nor a shudder. Instead, as Viira looked up to meet his eyes, she smiled and greeted him with a "you're looking well."\n\nPerhaps, had Silver been anypony else, Viira might have seen him as a threat that required eliminating. Together, however, she merely treated him as a partner, an ally... a friend?\n\nSilver, with a faint smile, greeted back."

Worrying over the frailty of mortality."\n\nLeopold's mechanical eye whirred as he sipped his drink, making Silver tense up slightly. "Do you fear me?" Leopold asked unexpectedly.\n\n"I- yes," Silver replied with a start, somewhat surprised at his own candidness.\n\n"And why is that?" Leopold placed his glass on the table beside him. "I've never once made an attempt on your life, have I?" At Silver's silence, the griffon added, "I've only spoken about bettering people. I've mostly referred to enhancements in strength and durability, true, but in essence, I want people to live better. And how do people who enjoy better lives fare?"\n\nSilver looked up. "They... they live longer," he answered, slowly understanding.\n\n"Exactly, Silver," Leopold said with a cackle. "Were we to work together, why, you could live forever. Wouldn't you fancy that?"\n\nSilver suddenly became very interested in what Leopold had to say."

Silver wasn't even sure why he'd come to Asinti's own abode—the mad stallion was talking to skulls!\n\nAsinti's cold eyes shifted. "What brings you here, Silver Star of Wittenland?" He spoke quietly yet with authority.\n\n"Did- did you know them?" Silver asked, trying not to imagine the corpses that the skulls once were.\n\nThe zebra rose to all four, a grimace forming on his face. "Not all of them," he admitted, "but they all deserve respect regardless."\n\nSilver had to fight against baulking at the idea of giving praise to skeletons—to death itself, but his reaction was still evident. "I know of your fears, young one." The elder zebra slowly approached the Wittenlander, and placed a hoof upon his shoulder. "I only wish to stop the institution that causes the needless pain and suffering that always ends in the deaths of innocents."\n\nThe unicorn turned to face the grinning skulls. Had he been born a zebra, how likely would it have been that his skull was part of Asinti's collection? Facing Asinti, Silver asked, "To stop their deaths and those of others?"\n\n"Wherever I am capable of doing so," he stated firmly, his grimace fading. "Why won't you help me to stop the deaths of those in suffering?"\n\nSilver mulled over his words. Perhaps he would never get over the absurdity of the skull collection. Still, he could put his unease aside to save others besides himself."

Yet, here he was, standing defiantly outside in the dead of night, driven by a force stronger than fear.

"My lord," he greeted, finding Ambrosius in the midst of one of his experiments, holding a vial that looked to be filled with blood.\n    Ambrosius turned around, slightly startled. Recognizing Gąsienica, he casually tossed the vial aside and asked, "Yes? What brings you here?"\n    "It's about Asinti, Viira, Leopold, and Silver Star," Gąsienica started, getting straight to the point.\n    "Have they done something amusing?" Ambrosius asked with clear excitation in his voice.\n    "No, my lord. They have, in fact, formed an alliance and ceased their conflicts," Gąsienica reported.\n    Upon hearing it Ambrosius bursted into laughter. It echoed off the stone walls, growing in intensity until it felt like it was repleacing the air in the room. And as the sound of laughter were consuming the room, shadows on the walls began stretching and expanding until they threatened to engulf everything in darkness.\n    Gąsienica acted swiftly. He reached for his master, pulling him close with one claw while retrieving a small vial of liquid from around his neck. Without hesitation he uncorked the vial and poured its contents into Ambrosius's open mouth. Upon drinking it, his body and spirit began to calm down, and so too did the shadows retreating to their corners.\n    Once Ambrosius was steady on his hooves again, Gąsienica asked, "Should I deal with them, my lord?""

  barrad_friends.6.d:0 "    The sun was setting, creating a rare backdrop for Silver Star who usually did not get outside at this hour. However, an invite from Leopold for a card games night was enough for him to change his usual habits. Although he had always been skeptical about card games until he discovered you can play them with others. He was so distracted by strategizing about the night ahead, he nearly missed out the subtle movement in the bushes beside the road.\n    At near instant alert he turned towards the noise, ready for whatever might emerge. His readiness paid off when a hooded figure with a knife jumped out of the bushes. Silver Star had imagined this exact situation too many times and reacted quickly, sidestepping the initial attack. As the attacker spun for a second strike, aiming for Silver Star's throat, the knife met not flesh but a magical barrier.\n    "Face your end, vile beast!" Silver Star shouted, convinced about his victory.\n    However, the assassin didn't waste time with barter. When their knife got stuck in the barrier, they pulled out a strange device that began draining the magic from Silver Star's shield. Caught off guard, Silver Star felt a rush of panic. Without time to think of a new plan, he channeled all his magic into a powerful beam that fired it at the attacker, hitting them in the head.\n    After ensuring there were no more attackers hiding nearby, Silver Star took a moment to catch his breath and approached the fallen assassin. Removing the hood revealed a zebra, which left Silver Star's confused. The cloak, adorned with odd symbols that matched those found in the cave the explored and on the garments of cultists Viira had taken an interest in, raised further questions."

Usually, identifying threats was straightforward for him, like spotting a clear stream in the daylight. Now, doubting the people he had grown close to felt uncomfortable and confusing. He thought inviting everyone to his tower might shed some light on this case — if someone had ill intentions, perhaps they'd skip the meeting. But they all showed up, leaving Silver Star still clueless. He hadn't mentioned what had happened that night, still trying to figure out the best way to bring it up.\n    "Silver, are you with us?" Leopold interrupted his thoughts. "You seem troubled."\n    Caught off guard Silver Star needed an excuse. "I... I'm just sad I missed our game night," he said.\n    "What game night?" Viira looked puzzled. "Are you sure you're not mixing it up with a dream?"\n    That question sent Silver Star's mind racing. He quickly thought it might be Leopold, or it was just a coverup to trick him. "Maybe that's it. I've been having trouble sleeping," he deflected.\n    "If you're having trouble sleeping, I have a great tonic for that," Asinti offered, sounding genuinely helpful.\n    Silver Star's suspicion momentarily jumped to Asinti. Would that tonic put him eternal slumber? But then he remembered that strange device, it didn't seem like alchemy.\n    "No, it won't make you sleep forever," said old zebra.\n    A telepath! Silver Star's mind shouted, But his inner monologue was interrupted once more by Asinti, "Sadly, I can't read others' thoughts."\n    "How did you know..." Silver Star began to ask.\n    "You tend to mumble when you're lost in thought," Viira pointed out with a smile.\n    "No, I don't," Silver Star denied, genuinely surprised.\n    "Yes, you do. No one just had the heart to tell you," Leopold added.\n    Viira laughed softly, finding the entire situation amusing. "I always thought it was kind of cute."\n    Silver Star stood there, completely bewildered, not sure how to process what was happening around him.\n    "Look, my friend," Leopold tried to reassure him, but Asinti cut in with a dose of practical wisdom.\n    "Think about it. If one of us, or even better, all of us wanted to kill you, we would have done it a long time ago," the old zebra said."

The black robes they wore fluttered around them, resembling the wings of some dark, otherworldly creatures.\n    The battle's intensity grew as the cultists, fueled by their fanatic devotion, seemed unstoppable. With eerie chants on their lips, calling upon their dark deity, drawing strength from their faith. Gąsienica and the four friends managed to break away from the ambush and press forward, leaving their soldiers behind. Soon they entered the cult's central chamber, a grand cathedral where they were met with an ominous silence. At the heart of the sanctum stood a massive gate, darker than the night sky itself. There,  Ambrosius lying unconscious on the altar. Seeing his master Gąsienica flew to assist him, but was stopped by a sudden gunshot.

But suddenly a thick cloud of smoke enveloped both griffons.\n    Viira, seizing the moment quickly dragged Leopold behind a large stone bench for cover. When Leopold tried to speak, she shushed him. "Hold your breath. I'll try to get Asinti here to help you," she whispered urgently, peeking over the bench. Through the clearing smoke, she saw Asinti and Gąsienica in a standoff, each waiting for the other to make the next move.\n    Driven more by instinct than by a well-thought-out strategy, Viira picked up a stone tablet from the bench and hurled it at Gąsienica, hoping to distract or, better yet, injure him. To her astonishment, he caught it mid-air and sent it flying towards Asinti with much greater speed. The tablet struck the old zebra in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.\n    As Viira tried to understand what had just happened, Gąsienica's gaze fixed on her. Seeing it she knew she had to run, though outrunning the griffon was unlikely. Preparing to flee, her mind filled with fear and desperation, she cried for a miracle to save her."

  barrad_friends.13.d:0 "Facing his worst nightmare, Silver Star was overwhelmed, but now he was also about to witness those close to him suffer a same terrible fate. As Gąsienica attacked Leopold, he was paralyzed by fear, unable to act, and instinctively sought refuge in the darkness. His whole body was frozen by the shock of the attack.\n    Lost in his fear, Silver Star hid, losing track of time in his panic. Seconds felt like hours as he tried to make sense of his thoughts, but the terror of his situation made it impossible to think clearly.\n    Then, a sharp scream snapped him out of his daze. It was Viira, trying to escape wrath of Gąsienica. Yet, what recourse did Silver Star possess, other than to flee as he had done countless times before? But in this very moment a chilling revelation crystalized within him."

She approached him slowly, subtly wiggling her eyebrows.\n    She reached out and grabbed his robe. "'It's something I should have done a long time ago," said Viira, coming face to face with him. Time seemed to slow, and sweat dripped down Silver Star's muzzle. "Goodbye." His eyes went wide, but before he had time to process what had happened, the deed was already done. Viira subtly kissed his forehead while still holding a dagger behind her back. "Be careful," she added."

Confused, she saw Silver Star standing before Gąsienica, trying to maintain a magical barrier between them. Fearing that any sound might break his concentration, she ran away to check on Asinti and Leopold.\n    "Are you both okay?" Viira asked as she approached, her voice full of concern.\n    Leopold, despite his injuries responded, "I've had worse." He held up a vial for Asinti. "This one?"\n    Asinti, weakly, corrected him, "Indigo, not purple."\n    Leopold finding the right potion, administered it to Asinti. "I hope this elixir has some effect," he murmured before collapsing to the ground, his eyes clouded by a haze of pain.\n    "Silver Star is fighting Gąsienica. We need to help him," Viira urged.\n    With every movement causing him pain, Leopold began to unbutton his suit. "I have a hypothesis," he said while revealing arcane machinery infused into part of his body. He began to detach part of it. "Get to him point-blank and connect these two cables," he explained while giving a magical crystal to Viira. "Don't lose it, I will die without it," he added with a heavy sigh.\n    "No! You can't risk your life like that," Viira protested.\n    "Just go and save that unicorn," he said, barely audible."

But each blow from the colossal griffon threatened to shatter the unicorn's defense, his hope of striking back fading like a dying ember.\n    In the midst of this chaos Viira emerged from the shadows seizing upon an opportune moment and rushed towards the griffon. Unseen by him, as he was focused on attacking the unicorn, she prepared a mysterious device Leopold gave her. Viira yelled for Silver Star to take cover, then activated the device causing a massive magical impulse that shook the room and incapacitated Gąsienica.\n    Viira quickly rushed to ensure Silver Star is alright, relieved to find him safe. Leopold and Asinti also appeared, supporting each other in standing straight. Seeing Gąsienica defeated, Leopold was started to look for the gun to finish him off.\n    Yet, as Silver Star looked at the defeated griffon crawling toward his unconscious master, a flicker of recognition danced within his mind. He heard the faint echoes of a familiar scene, the day he survived the savage Cossack raid as a mere foal. A loyal servant, who shielded him with his own body against the blades. For two harrowing days, Silver Star had lain beneath the lifeless form of his devoted servant, bearing witness to that very same look he saw in Gąsienica's eyes right now.\n    "Leave them," Silver Star commanded. Hearing Leopold's objections, Silver Star added "Let's be above this"."

The gate was covered in strange symbols that were impossible to understand and seemed to radiate a mysterious energy, drawing her closer despite herself.\n    The mysterious melody she heard was both unsettling and strangely inviting, making her come closer step by step. And as she was about to touch the black surface of the giant gate Silver Star's voice brought her back to reality.\n    "If you want to explore it we can come back later," said Silver Star. "Leopold needs us more at the moment."\n    Snapped from the trance Viira stepped away, her gaze still lingering on gate's ancient surface."

  barrad_asinti.6.d:0 "    Flickering candlelight danced on the reactor floor, with them the eerie glow from symbols carved into the floor. The air in the room was filled with various scents, but three stood out: incense, alcohol, and blood. Hooded zebras moved around, some preparing alchemical substances, others chanting ancient words. All of them shared one thing: they bled. With each movement, drops of blood fell to the floor, and Asinti watched carefully. What he was doing down there... nopony except his closest followers knew, but everycreature would be thankful to him when he was done. At least, that’s what the voice said.\n    At one moment, all the other zebras stopped. They did not need to say more – the ritual was prepared. Asinti walked to the center of the room and stood on the runes, his hooves now covered in blood. The sensation he felt at that moment was indescribable; it was as if the pure essence of magic flowed through his veins... or not even his mortal body but his spirit, his immortal soul. Many would have stood there in pure ecstasy, but Asinti began to chant, and the other zebras joined him. They moved in synchronization, as if directed by an invisible force.\n    The temperature in the room plummeted, candle lights burst into bright blue light and all scents vanished from the air. The walls of the reactor began to shake, and with each chant the fabric of reality was trembling. Suddenly, a thunderous wave knocked everyone in the room to the floor. It took a life worth of willpower to stand up, but Asinti managed to. As he looked around, searching for any sign that their efforts had yielded results. But the room was the same as before, the dim lights, the scents.\n    "I’ve failed again," Asinti whispered, dropping to his front knees. But then, almost instantly, a familiar voice echoed in his head, the voice he had hoped to hear with his ears and see with his eyes. "

But Asinti knew it’s timbre too well, something has happened. "You did very well. I'm proud of you," the words echoed through zebra’s mind.\n    "But nothing happened. You did not come," Asinti said aloud in frustration. "I must have done something wrong. There is..."\n    "Shhhh..." the voice interrupted, its tone yet again eerie whispers Asinti knew well. "You seem confused, and that might be my fault," It said. "We just eliminated our biggest obstacle, the so called god that the cultists worshipped."\n    "It was real?" Asinti asked, staring blankly into the air.\n    "Don't interrupt me," the voice continued. "You must now take over that cult and use them for our cause. When you are ready, I'll show you the ritual that you must carry out in the most sacred chambers of their grand cathedral."

"How long until we convince the unconvinced?"\n    "A week or two, master," the robed zebra answered, lowering his head.\n    Asinti nodded. "You may go now," he watched as his follower slowly backed out of the room.\n    Left alone, Asinti sank onto a pillow positioned in the center of intricate runic symbols carved into the floor. He needed a moment to calm himself after this meeting, but his rest was abruptly interrupted. "He still doesn't know," the voice echoed through Asinti's mind. "How long do you think you can go with this play?"\n    "Till the end of days," Asinti sighed. "The boy believes in our cause as much as I do."\n    "The boy? Not any longer, now he is a fine stallion," the voice responded. "And why are you so sure about him? Wouldn't his faith be shattered by the truth...?"\n    "Don't," Asinti interrupted.\n    "...that his very own father..." the voice ignored him.\n    "Stop," Asinti spoke louder.\n    "...not only kept his identity a secret from him... " those words pierced his chest.\n    "ENOUGH!

"I did what I had to... she tried to stop us..." he whispered, his voice breaking.\n    "As always, you are right, and I know that," the laughter ceased, the malice tone remained. "But are you sure that he knows that?" said the voice. "And that nopony who was present at that moment will never tell him?"\n    "They wouldn't..." Asinti's voice cracked.\n    "So you are not sure," the laughter echoed once more. "What if there was a way to ensure they never speak of it?"\n    "I..." Asinti's hooves trembled uncontrollably.

From the moment the cultists dared to kidnap his master, Gąsienica knew something was terribly wrong. His attempt to free Ambrosius had led him straight into a trap. Now, he lay on the cold stone floor, chained and bruised from relentless torture.\n    "I really admire your loyalty," Asinti said, his voice cold and calculated. "We could use someone like you in our ranks. Join us."\n    Gąsienica spat in response, his defiance unwavering.\n    Asinti sighed and signaled to a hooded figure, who handed him a vial filled with a shimmering liquid. "Very well, the hard way it is." He injected the fluid into Gąsienica’s arm. The griffon’s body convulsed as the substance took effect. Hours blurred into what felt like days. His fierce eyes became vacant, his body slumping against the cold stone floor. All the while, Asinti’s followers chanted their creed, their ritual prayers echoing through the chamber.\n    After what seemed like an eternity, Asinti returned to the chained griffon. Leaning closer, he asked, "Tell me, who do you serve?"\n    Gąsienica struggled to speak, his voice weak, "I... serve liberation. I serve you... master."\n    Asinti smiled, satisfied. "Good. You are beginning to see the truth."\n    Days passed, and Asinti’s words became ingrained in Gąsienica’s mind. Old loyalties were replaced with devotion to the cult's cause. Finally, the day came when Gąsienica stood before Asinti, his will completely broken.\n    "Who do you serve?" Asinti asked.\n    Gąsienica bowed his head, his voice hollow. "I serve liberation. I serve you, Master."\n    Asinti placed a hand on Gąsienica’s shoulder, a smile spreading across his face. "Welcome to the fold. Together, we will bring about a new era."\n    Gąsienica nodded in compliance. “Well done, very well done,” a voice echoed in Asinti’s mind."

He could barely believe it was written by him - it was incredibly detailed, meticulous, and most surprisingly, extremely well organized.\n    From the moment they met, Asinti had been suspicious about Ambrosius' alchemical prowess. Now, his suspicions were confirmed. Through means yet unknown to him, Ambrosius had managed to learn the secrets of potions used by the Chargers and fuse them with that Asinti could not recognise. According to the notes, these potions could even be used by weaker creatures, provided they had a strong enough will.\n    Reading further, Asinti stumbled upon a detailed description of an experiment designed to confirm this theory. It described how Gąsienica underwent the process. The subject was of above-average size and strength but was gravely wounded, simulating how a weaker creature's body would react to the potions. The next pages explained in great detail the changes his body underwent—how it was broken down and rebuilt from scratch. All this happened amidst excruciating pain, described by Ambrosius: "When trying to ask about the amount of pain the subject feels, he let out a scream so loud, so pleading, so... incomprehensible...

As he was about to step inside, he heard a loud shout. "Who's there?" It was one of Asinti’s followers. Thinking quickly, Leopold reached for a smoke bomb and threw it to the ground.

But to his surprise, the attacker didn’t pursue him. Instead, Silver Star found himself lying on the floor after tripping over other hooded figure that he haven’t noticed earlier. Before he could react further, a sharp pain exploded at the back of his head. Darkness engulfed him as he crumpled to the ground, unconscious."

  barrad_silver.22.d:0 "Truthfully, Silver Star didn't quite know what would happen after he had ascended into a Lich. When he was young, he'd read forbidden passages of powerful mages in the far north who had mastered the art of unlife. Still, those scraps of knowledge seemed to overlook something crucial: the amount a pony would have to sacrifice in order to gain immortality.\n\nSilver Star looked at his foreleg. Once vibrant in color and with neatly combed fur, it was now a shriveled, pale tan that lost patches of fur every time he brushed his hoof across it. It was... disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nHe tried to take solace in his victory over the Pentarchy, though the joy and vindication he had first felt seemed more elusive than ever. Emptiness seemed to be his primary emotion now, despite his best attempts to deny it.\n\nThe Archlich paused as he tried to focus on that phantom feeling. Perhaps... perhaps if he replicated it. If he became more powerful, if he defeated greater foes, then this emptiness might go away."

Despite being a rotting corpse, Leopold contained enough semblance of his former self to hold a conversation... at least, sometimes he could. Even then, Silver felt naught but a great vacuum where once he had enjoyed speaking with the griffon.\n\nOut of desperation, or perhaps foolishness, he commanded one of his undead to attack him in hopes that he would feel fear. Still nothing, he realized, as he tossed aside the now-inert skeleton.\n\nThis was becoming a serious problem. Silver looked down at his foreleg again. Some parts of the bone were starting to show through the various tissues and ligaments, and if he looked closely enough, he could see the magic aura that allowed his body to move in undeath. He briefly wondered if becoming a lich might have been a mistake.\n\nSilver shook his head to rid himself of that notion. No, there was no mistake. He simply hasn't found what would make him truly happy, yet. He simply needed to keep looking, to keep trying...\n\nHis thoughts turned to the Kingdom of Wittenland from which he had been ostracized. A kingdom... yes, that would do it. He needed to build a great kingdom, and then he would find his eternal joy."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.1.t:0 "First Contact"
  bar_sane_ambrosius.1.d:0 "Deep beneath the surface of Barrad, Count Ambrosius stood before the reactor with Gąsienica at his side. Ambrosius was in awe of the majestic device, and ephemeral voices beckoned him to approach it, come closer... He did, shambling towards it until suddenly the voices stopped and the pain started.\n\nIt was as if an entire universe was trying to make its home inside his skull! Unable to withstand it, he keeled over, screaming in pain. He brought his hooves to his head in an attempt to keep it from bursting from all he felt inside it. Upon seeing Ambrosius' state, Gąsienica was frantic, and poured many doses of the Count's medicine into his open mouth. Was this much of the drug unsafe? Gąsienica didn't know, but he had to do something.\n\nWithin the mind of Ambrosius, he fought against the invading presence with all his will. His thoughts were chaotic and it was impossible to centre himself. All seemed to be a whirlwind of hatred and hostility, until he noticed a voice inside the cacophony that was different from the rest. He sensed this part of the presence did not wish him harm, and so he focused on it. It told him what the presence truly was, that it was the product of seven ancient unicorns who had used a primordial spell from another age to merge together into one consciousness, but now was totally dependent on magic in order to survive. It told him that they did not want to cause all this, but that Ambrosius had unleashed a power that had corrupted them. Finally, it told him that it would use the last of its uncorrupted will to free him from his madness.\n\nAmbrosius awoke to find Gąsienica beside him, grateful to see him alive. For the first time in an eternity, the fog was gone. His thoughts were finally clear. He felt like vomiting, but there wasn't time. He was responsible for an immense mistake, and there was no time to waste in putting things right. "Return to the surface, Gąsienica," said Ambrosius. "I must stay here and work on a way to fix what I have broken. Make sure things don't fall apart out there in the meantime.""

After emerging from a narrow pass, he smiled as he laid eyes on his home village at peace. The aftermath of their battle with the plants was still visible, but now the mangled monstrosities were overgrown by vegetation of a more mundane variety.\n\nAs soon as he entered the town Jánošík came out to greet him, laughing heartily. "Good to see you, friend! Come to drag us out of the fire again?" He gave Gąsienica a playful punch which had absolutely no effect.\n\n"Not this time, fortunately," said Gąsienica. "In fact, I have come to ask you for assistance. The Count is... away dealing with a matter of some importance. As you are a more respected figure than I among the mountain villages, your support would be appreciated at this time." Jánošík wore a mask of inscrutable contemplation. "Since he protected you in your time of need, it's only fair that you help him in return."\n\n"No, no." Jánošík wagged a claw. "It wasn't him that saved us, it was you. And so I will do this for you." His voice shifted to become deadly serious. "Under one condition - if we are to respect your rule, you should respect ours. Promise that our villages will retain their autonomy, and I will help." Gąsienica nodded, and the two shook claws."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.3.d:0 "Gąsienica walked cautiously down dark forest paths in search of the mysterious merchant Jánošík had dealt with in the past. It was this dealer that had provided them the artifact to ward off the corrupted plants when no other means proved effective, and any creature trading in such powerful magic was worth seeking out. Gąsienica had gone to the last place Jánošík said he met with the merchant, but saw only abandoned buildings with no civilisation in sight.\n\nHe was on the verge of giving up hope when a raspy voice slithered out from the darkness. "A visitor?" Gąsienica turned around and was surprised to find a stallion dressed in discoloured rags beckoning to him. As Gąsienica approached, the stallion gave a wide smile, revealing a glimmering gold tooth. "Come in!" He disappeared into a decrepit shack with Gąsienica following behind.\n\n"You have come a long way looking for something, haven't you?" The stallion looked over the strange items that covered the walls before rummaging through one of the many containers laying haphazardly around the shack. "How about this?" He asked, pulling out an item and tossing it to Gąsienica. "This artifact will ensure you gain the favour of the people," he explained. Gąsienica ran his claws over the teardrop shaped object and could feel the magical power within. "Use it during the wet season to increase crop yields by an enormous amount."\n\nGąsienica had found his merchant, but this was quite unexpected. "You're just... giving it to me?" he asked.\n\n"You have earned it." The merchant raised his hooves high in praise. "You have done more good for this land than you know, my griffon friend!""

  bar_sane_ambrosius.4.d:0 "Gąsienica met with members of the lesser nobility to assess their loyalty during the Count's absence, and was disturbed by the results. Although they all paid lip service and reaffirmed their fealty to Ambrosius, Gąsienica could see the plotting and scheming behind their flattery. They sensed an opportunity, and were simply waiting for the right time to make their move. It was clear that they were far from convinced, words alone would not be enough."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.5.t:0 "Divine Disfavour"
  bar_sane_ambrosius.5.d:0 "Gąsienica traveled to contact a shadowy cult that operated at the fringes of Barradian society. Although a bit obscure, they had several wealthy patrons and wielded a lot of influence, so gaining their support could prove very useful. When he reached their secluded compound, he found a scene of chaos and heated arguments. No two cultists had kind things to say to one another, and the volatile atmosphere felt like it could combust into violence at any moment.\n\nIt seemed that the Pentarchy's actions had ultimately created a schism within the cult. None of the members had heard from their god in some time, and they felt the deity's influence was growing weaker by the day. Those in the cult's Inner Circle accused the Outer Circle of being faithless, while those in the Outer Circle accused the Inner Circle of becoming corrupt and rotten, prompting their god to abandon them.\n\nGąsienica sighed. He didn't have time for this."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.6.d:0 "Gąsienica descended back underground to rejoin the Count, now that he was at last ready to exorcise Barrad's ancient curse. When Gąsienica reached him, Ambrosius looked tired, having studied magical texts nearly nonstop preparing the ritual to heal the being that had driven him to madness and back. Gąsienica held his breath as Ambrosius approached the reactor to perform the ritual. When he began the ritual in earnest, power started swirling all around them until suddenly, everything stopped, and the world became still.\n\nA voice spoke to both of them, but it was not the elusive, shifting voice Ambrosius was used to hearing. It was a calm voice, low and quiet but at the same time not difficult to hear. "I am awake." The presence in the air washed over them like an ocean current. "My actions have wrought so much pain, so much destruction. For that, I can not express the magnitude of my sorrow." The room seemed to somehow fill with sadness. "But now I am freed from hunger and chaos, and I wish to do now what I have been unable to do for far too long. Let us make this world a better place."\n\nGąsienica was in shock from what he was witnessing and was completely unsure how to react. Ambrosius, however, smiled. "Yes, let's.""

A single candle casted flickering shadows across the faded, peeling wallpaper. Ambrosius sat on a bed in middle of the room, his eyes fixed on the portrait hanging in front of him. It was of him and a mare, her beauty immortalized in vibrant colors. Yet, the painting, just like Ambrosius himself, had withered over the years. Her gaze seemed to follow him, full of life and warmth - a ghost of better days. \n    He took a deep breath, as he stared at her face, her smile, her eyes, and could only wonder: why had it had to come to this? The mad count of a broken land, a thief and a murderer. His voice little more than a whisper. "I can’t stop now..."\n    The silence of the room pressed in on him. Minutes passed, or perhaps hours, time had little meaning for him right now. The quiet was all-encompassing, a weight that hung over him like a shroud.\n    Then, from behind, he felt as if somepony was watching him. Ambrosius didn’t move, didn’t look up. He knew who it was. He had learned how to sense him. Gąsienica simply stood there, watching his master. Without a word, he moved next to Ambrosius and squatted down. He did not speak, for there were no words needed between them.\n    Ambrosius did not look at him. His gaze remained fixed on the portrait, though his voice trembled slightly when he finally spoke. "How is the party?" Ambrosius murmured.\n    “Tame,” Gąsienica replied, glancing at the mare in the portrait. "Is something wrong, my lord?"\n    Ambrosius was silent for a long moment. Slowly, he lifted his head and looked at the portrait one last time, then let out a long, weary sigh. "I never apologized to you," he said quietly.\n    "I owe my life to you," Gąsienica responded.\n    "Your mother begged me to save you after you were wounded," Ambrosius said, staring directly at the griffon. "I could have done it in so many different ways. Yet because of my ambition, I had to try the dark magic that was shown to me in my dreams." A single tear fell from his eye. "I can still hear your screams to this very day. No creature should have to endure what you did."\n    Gąsienica extended one of his massive talons and gently placed it on Ambrosius’ shoulder. "I forgive you," he said in a low voice, "for that and the other things you had in mind."\n    Ambrosius was not ready for that answer. His mind had created so many different scenarios, but he could not have predicted this one. He reached up and patted Gąsienica’s talon in gratitude, the only gesture he could think of at that moment.\n    "My lord, do you wish me to go back and entertain the guests in your name, or fetch a bottle for us?" Gąsienica asked firmly."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.1003.d:0 "    In the depths of his restless slumber, Ambrosius perceived a voice he had not heard in many a moon—a wicked hymn of the cultists' deity, now transformed into a hauntingly harmonious melody that chilled his very soul. An inexorable summons compelled him to meet this enigmatic entity face to face, to traverse its sacred halls, for there was that which he must behold with his own eyes.\n    Upon standing in front of the gate darker than the night sky, Ambrosius heard a soft whisper. It pushed him ever closer. Without realizing it, he sank into the halls behind the gate. What he saw etched itself indelibly upon his psyche, scarring his mind until the end of his mortal days, or maybe even those which would come after. He had felt the song of this ancient entity for so many years; he had heard its will. Its influence penetrated all corridors of his mind. Yet to see it with his eyes, to stand in front of it, to be surrounded by its presence—all he could do was drop to his knees.\n    "Do... not... be... afraid..." a harmonic voice spread from the depths of his mind to the very air around him.\n    "Stand... up... I... We... need... show..." a second voice, this one emanating from realms beyond the physical plane.\n    "You... must... know... help... prevent..." a third voice sang from the very center of the room.\n    Ambrosius, driven by an unknown force, stood up. He did not speak, but he was ready for what the entity had to show him. Sensing his willingness, a deluge of visions went straight into his mind. He beheld shapes impossible to recreate within the confines of physical reality, melodies morphing into colors beyond his imagination. The cacophony of this harmonic song, resonating through his senses, lasted mere moments, but for Ambrosius it was an eternity. In his mind, thousands of candles flickered, creating waves that extinguished the howling melodies echoing inside his skull.\n    "You... saw... we... do... not... know..." a fourth voice proclaimed.\n    "Past... present... no... future..." a fifth voice enveloped the room like a fog.\n    "Potential... good... has... you..." a sixth voice cried out from the depths of his own consciousness.\n    "As... I... us... not... follow..." a seventh voice whispered, fading into the abyssal silence."

The visions were blurry at best—incomprehensible at worst. He had no idea what to do with it, no one to ask about it... but what if... what if he already had them? The entity spoke about the past. What if the guests he invited were not an accident? What if he had seen this earlier, just the fog that covered his mind made him forget?\n    Maybe the answers were closer than he thought. Maybe the other pentarchs could still be of use even after death."

He let them linger, but when silence returned as sole reply, he pressed on. "So, maybe we should start over again how the situation looks like so it might be easier to find a solution to it."\n    The room remained quiet, except for Asinti's heavy sigh. He had heard this more times than he cared to count, each repetition seemingly more fruitless than the last. Expecting the griffon to speak up any moment, he swept over the room. His gaze paused on Viira, she seemed disconnected from the what is happening around, her stare piercing through the mortal veil into some distant abyss. It was a look he knew too well—the haunting sight of someone who had faced death. His attention then shifted to Silver Star. Despite the recent chaos, the unicorn appeared outwardly calm, but Asinti could sense an inner turmoil. Whatever Silver Star was wrestling with remained a mystery for him now.\n    Leopold, not deterred by their silence, began, "Given our recent actions, we're now facing..."\n    "We get it," Asinti cut in before Leopold could outline their bleak situation again. "Ambrosius is in a coma, cultists are on the warpath, chaos reigns, and everypony is vying for power. While Gąsienica is trying to reestablish some order with the fire and sword." He locked eyes with Leopold. "Did I miss anything?"\n    "That sums it up," Leopold conceded. "Which is why I believe we should ignite the reactor. It might just give us the advantage we need." He turned to Viira, "What do you think, my deer?"\n    "I... I don't really know," Viira's response was barely audible.\n    Leopold, persistent, tried to rally support from her, his questions becoming increasingly insistent as he sought to persuade her. As Asinti began to argue with him, their voices merged into a meaningless cacophony for Viira. The world around her dimmed, memories flashing in the encroaching darkness. The rapid beating of her heart was the last tether to reality before her mind spiraled into the void. And in that moment of near dissolution, a simple feeling of warmth snapped her out of it. Opening her eyes, she found Silver Star trying to hug her.\n    "Leopold is right, we should ignite it," Silver Star suddenly declared, his confidence surprising for the rest. "But there are only four of us, which is why we need Gąsienica to return the favor. Hopefully, this settles the debate," he added. Rest of the group only looked at eachother and responded:"

"Didn't expect any of you to come back," he remarked.\n    "You're welcome," Leopold shot back.\n    "We have something to propose," Silver Star quickly added.\n    Gąsienica didn't move an inch, his posture alert and ready as if anticipating a fight. Viira, feeling the tension, instinctively moved slightly behind Silver Star.\n    Seeing Viira's subtle move, Silver Star went ahead with what they had come to say. "We think we've got a way to wake up Ambrosius," he said, keeping his eyes on Gąsienica for any reaction.\n    At the mention of his lord Gąsienica flinched, most would not notice but Silver Star was very keen on seeing any kind of movement.\n    "The reactor, it has great magic potential. We believe we can use that power to heal Ambrosius," unicorn explained.\n    "What do you need me to do?" Gąsienica asked.\n    "We need some time to make this work, and we need somepo... somegriff to keep the cultists off our backs," Silver Star laid out.\n"

They might back out of our deal if they think I've been dishonest."\n    "Are you always this helpful?" Silver Star remarked with iritation.\n    "Obviously you haven't hung around him enough," a cheerful voice added as another griffon had quietly flew behind them.\n    Gąsienica responded, "And you could've been on time, Janosik."\n    Janosik just shrugged it off. "I'm on time. They were just wrapping up their prayers. I think I've convinced all the key figures to meet," he said, walking up to Silver Star and patting him on the back. "So, you're the new ally Gąsienica mentioned? Nice to meet you."\n    Silver Star was thrown off, not just by Janosik's friendliness but also by his ridiculously large hat. Nonetheless, he replied, "Good to meet you too."\n    "Not big on talking, are you?" Janosik observed. "Are you here alone?"\n    Silver Star just nodded, slowly realizing he is going to be surrounded by the griffons and one of them nearly killed him.\n    "Don't worry, you'll be fine at the party with me. I'll make sure you don't drink too much," Janosik assured him.\n    "Party?" Silver Star was now clearly confused.\n    "Didn't Gąsienica tell you? You think we will make arrangement with someone we haven't drink with?," Janosik said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n    The giant griffon's piercing gaze became even more intense, as if that was possible.

However, this time Gąsienica and his troops were well-prepared, understanding exactly whom they were up against. With fire and gas, his forces penetrated the depths of the underground sanctuary, claiming nearly all of it under our control.\n    Meanwhile, a different drama unfolded on the surface. In a seemingly desperate maneuver, a cult's high priestesses was waiting in the shadow of night for her targets to fall asleep. She waited patiently, and at the first sign of opportunity, she entered the building through a window.\n    "Lost, are we?" a voice emerged from the darkness of the room.\n    The priestess remained silent, scanning the shadows to locate the speaker.\n    "No need to act like a foal," the voice added. Suddenly, the priestess felt movement behind her. Before she could react, someone grabbed her mane, and in one swift motion, she was thrown to the floor.\n    The sound of body slamming into the floor drew three more creatures into the room, who quickly turned on the lights."Asinti, what is going on?" Silver Star shouted.\n    "Just got us a new friend," Asinti replied, pointing at the unicorn he was holding down on the floor.\n    "And she is?" Leopold asked with sleepy voice.\n    "Gebléod, devoted servant of our lord and master," the unicorn stated in a soft voice marked by a distinct foreign accent. "And soon to be the death of you and other heathens," she added.\n    "Weird way of spelling prisoner" Asinti responded as he pulled her mane down further."

Viira, was not sure, her thoughts preoccupied by a far more important things. With attention fixed on the enormous crystal destined to soon become hearth of the reactor, she heard a hauntingly familiar voice. Viira, Viira, Viira... It felt like the crystal itself was calling her by the name.\n    "Viira!" Asinti's voice snapped her back to reality. "Are you alright? I'm quite worried about you."\n    "No, no. I'm fine," she replied hastily, "Do you need my help with anything?"\n    "Quite the contrary," the old zebra looked at her. "Tell me, what is troubling you?"\n    "Nothing, really," Viira looked away. But even if not facing him she could still feel his gaze, there was something utterly sinister in it like he was looking thought her mind and soul. She could only withstand it for a moment. "Can I ask you something?"\n    "Of course," said Asinti.\n    "Have you ever... hurt someone you cared about?" The question lingered for a while.\n    "I have," he admitted, but it was clear the answer did not same to him easily. Old zebra's expression changed like an arrow pierced his hearth.\n    "And how did it make you feel afterward?" Viira pressed on.\n    "Horrible," he confessed after a long moment of silence. His eyes locked with Viira's, for a moment it appeared like there was a sight of regret in them. "But there was always a greater reason, and The price paid was already too high," he added.\n    "Would you do it again?" Viira inquired.\n    Asinti weighted words he was about to say. "I... I'm not sure if I have the strength anymore,"\n    Viira wanted to digest his words, but she couldn't. Overwhelmed, tears started to stream down her face, and soon, she was sobbing uncontrollably. The sound of her crying halted Leopold and Silver Star's argument, drawing their attention.\n    "Shhh... young one," Asinti said softly, hugging her. "There's no need to cry."\n    "But there is!" she cried out between sobs. "I-I-I was about to kill you all!" Her confession filled with anguish. "The reactor, the cult—it's not what you think!" Her tears flowed freely now.\n    Feeling a comforting touch on her back, and then another, Viira opened her eyes to see Silver Star and Leopold attempting to console her, their expressions a mix of concern and relief.

"But it appears to be best course of action."\n    "Please, let's think this through once more," said the griffon.\n    "We've already been over this," Silver Star responded, meticulously reviewing the sensor one last time to ensure everything was set correctly.\n    "I really hope you know what we're doing," Leopold sighed, turning his attention back to fine-tuning the equipment. Without looking away from the task at his claw, he asked, "And how are you holding up Viira?"\n    The deer, nestled in a corner of the room had been sitting awfuly quiet. The revelations she had shared with her friends about the cult, the reactor, and her initial intentions had left her in a whirlpool of emotions. She wrestled with feelings of shame, regret, anger at the missed opportunity. Yet amidst it all, she found... a relief. Despite deception and lying being her second nature, sharing the truth with her friend felt suprisingly great. The support and understanding they offered in response to her confession had been unexpected but immensely comforting. They came up with a new plan, use the reactor's power to obliterate the ancient entity, aiming to liberate Barrad from its curse once and for all.\n    "Quiet day, huh?" Leopold attempted to once again banter with Viira.\n    "I'm just worried," she admitted, her voice tinged with apprehension.\n    "A bit late for second thoughts," Asinti commented, turning towards her. "We're ready for ignition."\n    Silver Star chimed in, "Not sure about the side effects. I suppose those more sensitive to magic might experience some discomfort when we shoot this much energy at the god," he said, trying to offer a reassuring smile."

"Except of course attempt on my life." His gaze drifted to a painting on the wall, depicting himself and a mare unknown to the rest of the group. "What do you believe I should do?".\n    Silver Star tried to respond but was quickly interrupted by Ambrosius, who looked directly at him. "During my slumber, I was blessed with clarity I didn't remember I had. With it came reflection," said old pony. "I've come to realize the amount of ruin I bringed into my lands." He made a feeble attempt to adjust his position, but his body refused to cooperate. "I could try to redeem myself with my deeds, but they could suffice." He voice got heavier, "Silver Star, please come closer."\n    With hesitation, the unicorn came closer to the bed.\n    "You once showed me mercy." Tears got into Ambrosius' eyes as he continued, "please, show mercy again and rule Barrad instead of me."\n    Silver Star was stunned by the Ambrosius' words.

Worst part of it was that his friends were all willing to support him no matter what. But he did not want any of it, just the thought of bearing responsibility not only for his friends but whole country was overwhelming, making him want to hide away in darkest corner. Then a melody caught his attention, a piano piece so tender it momentarily swept away his concerns. Curious to discover its source, he followed the sound, hoping to distract himself from his swirling thoughts. \n    "Beautiful song," Silver Star remarked, upon finding the creature behind the music.\n    Gąsienica caught off guard, ceased playing. "Thank you, my lord," he said.\n    "I'm no lord," Silver Star corrected him. "What is this piece? I've never heard anything like it."\n    "Only two beings knew it, and now only I do," Gąsienica answered, now with his usual tone.\n    "And the other was?" Silver Star pressed.\n    "A pony who taught me to play, and a dear friend," said Gąsienica, pausing before adding, " Better known as my former lord's wife."\n    As Silver Star approached the piano, he looked up at Gąsienica. "Don't think I ever met her," he admitted.\n    "She's long dead," Gąsienica said, staring into the distance. "She wanted me to kill master Ambrosius, in response I was ordered to execute her."\n    The unicorn tried to say something, but could not find proper words. Seeing him struggle the griffon added, "Gladly under your rule I won't need to do it again."\n    "What makes you think so?" Silver Star was confused by the sudden shift.\n    Gąsienica met his gaze squarely. "Am I mistaken, my lord? Just give me an order."\n    "No, no, no!" Silver Star shouted. "I... I never sought such responsibility," he confessed more softly.\n    "But it is yours now," Gąsienica stated.

They managed to unleash the waters of underground lakes into the Elis River, causing a devastating flood which affected all nearby towns and villages.\n    However, amidst this hour of trial, when many ponies lives were lost and countless more lost off what they had, a miracle happened. Before the Pentarchy or Gąsienica could organize any formal relief efforts, the common ponies took the matter in their own hoofs. They came together, raising sandbags to curb the flooding, helping to evacuate, and providing shelter to those who had lost their homes.

"I'd be lying if I said the thought of us fighting each other had never crossed my mind, but now that it's actually happening..." He was walking around, his eyes not focused on anything.\n    "Do you require any aid?" Asinti asked, concern evident in his tone. "I could prepare some potions or tonics for you."\n    "Or a gun, if you need one," Leopold chimed in.\n    "Last time that worked perfectly, didn't it?" Silver Star replied with a wry smile. "Don't worry, I can handle it on my own."\n    "We just want to make sure you're alright," Asinti said, picking up a cup. "Having some help wouldn't be considered cheating, would it?" he added, taking a sip.\n    "If there's any way we can help you beat your sister, just say the word," Leopold said, patting Silver Star on the back supportively.\n    "Again, thank you, but I don't..." Silver Star began to respond but was suddenly cut off by the loud crack of the doors swinging open. Viira burst into the room, visibly upset.\n    "What are you planning, you idiot?" she demanded.\n    "To finish my tea," Asinti responded calmly.\n    Viira hissed, "Not you!" She turned to Silver Star, her frustration palpable. "Tell me you're not going to fight your sister just to prove a point."\n    "I'm not going to fight my sister to prove a point," he repeated after her.\n    "Then what are you even planning?" Viira sighed, her anger subsiding into worry.\n    "I'm planning to duel my sister to take the crown so that we..." Silver Star started to explain, but Viira quickly interrupted him.\n    "I'm sorry, now this plan sounds so reasonable," she said sarcastically. "Remind me, how did she get her crown?"\n    "In a duel..." Silver Star replied reluctantly.\n    "And since then, how many others have challenged her to get the crown?" she pressed on.\n    "Through duels..." Silver Star acknowledged, seeing where the conversation was heading.\n    "And when was the last time you dueled someone?" she asked pointedly.\n    "I fared well against Gąsienica, and against that assassin one time..." he attempted to defend his skills.\n    "Ah yes, the giant griffon we nearly fried. And remind me, what happened to that assassin? Did you evaporate him?" Viira stepped closer.\n    "Maybe," he muttered.\n    "Still see no connections?" she pressed, standing face to face with him. "It could end the same way."\n    "My sister wouldn't..." Silver Star said with doubt in his voice.\n    "I'm talking about you," Viira was staring directly at him. "What if you..." She pulled him into a tight hug, tears welling up in her eyes. "I'm just worried that you might get hurt, or your sister—I know you'd blame yourself for it."\n    Silver Star gently patted her on the back. "

"What are you doing?" she asked.\n    Silver Star looked up, his eyes visibly tired. "Oh... Sorry, I didn't notice you," he mumbled while crumpling the letter he was working on and tossing it aside.\n    "Do you need any help?" Viira was stepping over the papers that littered the floor.\n    "No, no," Silver Star responded quickly, then reaching for another blank sheet. "I got this."\n    Viira looked around at the paper-strewn room, her voice laced with a hint of playful concern. "For the sake of the well-being of these poor trees, I insist."\n    Just as he was to write first word, Silver Star stopped and asked. "You're not going to leave?"\n    "No," Viira finally making her way to his desk. She pulled up a chair and sat down beside him. "So what are you trying to write?"\n    "A letter," Silver Star responded.\n    "To whom?" she asked.\n    "My sister," his response was nearly a whisper.\n    Viira nodded.

This time however, the letter was bore a name all too familiar to the queen. It signed by her brother Silver Star. He explained the current situation and recent events, mentioning something about ancient cults and powerful magic. Yet White Star more interested by the fact that a significant portion of the letter was devoted to the creatures he now calls his friends.\n\nStrange emotions overtook the queen. Her brother, lost to the world for so many years, was now safe, and according to the letter, seemed happy. Having compassion for one's own brother is natural, but what of those he has surrounded himself with? White Star was unsure if they should or could be shown any sympathy."

Mere sight of it made Silver Star to tense up. Respecting the need for privacy his friends quietly left the room, leaving Viira who chose to stay behind.\n    Silver Star opened the letter, initially greeted by warm, familiar words from his sister. This brought a brief smile to his face. However it quickly faltered and then disappeared as he read her words condemning the actions of his companions, accusing them of transgressions against her subjects and threatening severe repercussions\n    The letter slipped from his hooves and fell to the floor as he struggled to process his emotions. Tears began to form in Silver Star's eyes as he felt the possibility of losing his friends. Before he could realize it he was embraced by Viira, bringing his head close to her chest. After wiping tears out of his eyes he noticed that Leopold and Asinti were also standing by his side.\n    Silver Star comforted by the tangible presence of his friends felt a flicker of hope ignite within him. As even if he was about to walk thought the darkest of valleys, he will not do it alone anymore."

The smell of freshly printed pages filled his study, a place where he usually found comfort. But tonight the texts he was reading were making him feel uneasy.\n    Suddenly, the silence was broken. Viira entered the room unexpectedly, causing some books to fall off an already crowded desk. She picked up one of the books, "Modern Theory of Nation State Relations," and read the title out loud with a hint of sarcasm. Then looked at Silver Star, curious. "What are you doing up here all by yourself?"\n    "Just... nothing," Silver Star mumbled, with embarrassed in his barely audible voice.\n    Viira looked around at the scattered books. "That's a whole lot of  nothing," she commented while handing back the book she had picked up.\n    Silver Star accepted the book and sighed as he opened it again. "I think I missed out on learning some important stuff about politics... and how to get along with others," he admitted quietly.\n    Viira laughed gently, clearly amused. "You probably want to be left alone with your books?" she said.\n    In response Silver Star only nodded in silence.\n    Ignoring his nod, Viira suggested, "How about instead we study this together?" Her tone was soft but convincing.\n    Silver Star's heart raced as he looked surprised but pleased. "I would be more than happy to," he said, his voice firmer yet excited."

  barrad_friendship_tree.22.d:0 "    Truth be told, Asinti wasn't particularly interested in cataloging all the creatures in Barrad, he mainly sought a pretext to find solitude. Or at least as much solitude as one could have in his position. Nestled deep in the Barradian countryside, only his most devoted followers dared to visit him—along with his new friends. In fact, these new relationships were precisely why Asinti found himself wrestling with his thoughts so intensely lately. Halting his life's work would be challenging for anyzebra, but for him it was particularly daunting. Not only had he sacrificed so much already, but failing to achieve his goals would mean that all his actions would be in vain.\n    "I told you, you shouldn't dwell on it," a too familiar voice interrupted his solitude. "How many times must I remind you to continue our work?" the disembodied voice persisted, urging him on. "Just think of all the good we could still achieve."\n    "And what about them?" Asinti asked aloud to the empty tent.\n    "If they stand in our way... the same as last time," the voice replied in a lower tone. "We will get rid of them."\n    "But..." Asinti's voice cracked.\n    "No buts, my dear," the voice cut him off sharply. "We can't disappoint all those who depend on us when we are this close, can we?" it added in a whisper, "especially after everything we've done."\n    "You're right..." Asinti conceded with a heavy sigh.\n    "See?" the voice perked up, sounding pleased. "Now, be a good zebra and let go of this sentimental nonsense."\n    "That's what we want," Asinti continued, half to himself, "not what I want."\n    His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by thunderous laughter that echoed so loudly it nearly drowned out his own thoughts. "And what are you going to do?" the laughter transformed back into the familiar voice. "Tell the spirit of your brother he died for nothing? Or..." the voice grew louder, more insistent. "Do you want to return to being a slave? Is that the fate you truly want for yourself and your fellow creatures, for Illi's foals?"\n    "Silence!" Asinti shouted at the empty room. "Don't speak her name."\n    "Struck a nerve?" the voice laughed mockingly. "Good, perhaps this will help you come to your senses."\n    "The sun will freeze sooner," Asinti retorted, firm in his resolve. "I want nothing more to do with you.""

  barrad_friendship_tree.23.d:0 "    As Asinti walked through the small village while his follower conducted a census. There was something eerily familiar about this place but he could not point exactly what. It was reminiscent of the village they had once established in Kasa. Everything felt much simpler back then, and memories of those days stirred within him, prompting reflections on the choices he had made. What if he had taken different paths? How different might life have been?\n    "You would have ended up as just another nameless slave," a voice in his head answered.\n    Asinti determined not to engage with it, concentrated all his strength on recalling those distant memories. His effort paid off, and a serene image formed in his mind. Zebras constructing a new home, foals playing joyfully around them, and beside him... her, smiling as always. But in a blink, it all changed. The smiling face dissolved into tears, the tears turned to blood. Asinti's heart raced as he saw the zebras constructing a pyre and the foals now chanting dark spells. He knew  what would come next, but was abruptly pulled from his vision by a small, squeaky voice.\n    "I'm sorry, mister," a young filly pulled his robe, her eyes wide and fearful. "You're looking for ponies, can you help us?"\n    "What do you need, young one?" Asinti asked.\n    "I can't find my mommy and dad," the filly began to cry. "I haven't seen them since some ponies in black robes came."\n    Asinti knew all too well what the cultists did to those they took, and a dark thought crossed his mind, whispered by the persistent voice in his head. Innocent blood, so pure and precious... it holds a lot of power. He quickly shook the thought from his mind, ignoring the voice's objections.\n    "Mister..." the filly tugged at his robe again, her tears having dried. "...we can't find my friends' mommies either."\n    Old zebra looked down at the innocent face before him. It would be so easy, so quick, so satisfying... His body tingled with the temptation, one command and he could claim their souls for our cause. We both know there is only one right choice.\n    "Yes, I know," Asinti said aloud, making his decision. "Come, little one, gather your friends and I will help you look for your parents."\n    The foal's face lit up with a grateful smile. "Thank you, thank you, mister!" she exclaimed as she ran towards one of the houses to call her friends."

A rare moment for him, break from all those grand schemes.\n    Unfortunately the quiet of the night was broken by a noise from behind. The sound of somepony stepping on a wooden plank made him instantly alert. But the hoofsteps were very light and careful, there was only one creature in Elysium he knew who had that kind of delicate step.\n    "Why are you here? I thought you'd have your own things to do at night," Silver Star asked, without turning to look, his attention still partly on the sky.\n    "Said the one standing on the balcony," Viira replied. Her voice coming from the room's shadows, gradually moving towards the unicorn.\n    Silver Star finally looked away from the stars to see her. "I was just enjoying the stars," he admitted with a smile.\n    "Might I admire the star as well?" Viira said, smiling back as she stepped beside him.\n    "Sure," he responded, feeling a bit lighter with her company.\n    They both turned their eyes to the night sky. But soon the chill of the night air became more noticeable. Silver Star caught up in the beauty around him hardly felt the cold. Unlike Viira who feeling the chill, moved closer to him until they were gently touching. She then rested her head on his arm, comfortable in the silence and his presence.\n    "Viira," Silver Star started quietly.\n    "Shh," she cut him off. "Let's just enjoy the view.""

We've been looking everywhere for you," he exclaimed, his voice rising with each word. "You won't believe it! Asinti has a son!" He looked around, but due to the lack of response, he started approaching the bed.\n    Just then, Asinti appeared in the doorway, his expression showing that he was equally moved by their discovery. "You're still under the duvet, I see. Better get up, or our enthusiastic friend here might just drag you out," he joked.\n    Leopold, continuing with undiminished vigor, said, "It begins like most interesting story I'll ever hear, and he will not continue without you" as he turned towards the bed. "Are you there?"\n    From beneath the folds of the duvet emerged Silver Star, his mane messy and his eyes showing signs of a sleepless night. "I'm here, I'm here," he murmured, his voice heavy with fatigue.\n    Leopold, with a sympathetic smile, asked, "Rough night?" But before he could continue, something else caught his attention. A sudden movement in the duvet next to Silver Star grew into a noticeable bulge, from which Viira appeared, yawning loudly and stretching wide. It took her a moment to notice the others in the room, and upon realizing she wasn't alone, her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.\n    The room fell silent, an awkward tension hanging in the air, only to be broken by Asinti's hearty laughter.\n    "Leopold, my friend," he said with a playful tone, "I hate to break it to you, but it seems much more interesting things had happened here." He gestured towards the door with a knowing look. "Come, I heard our presence is requested somewhere else."\n    Leopold and Asinti left the room quickly, their steps fading down the hallway, leaving behind a room filled with a kind of silence only seen under a bright night sky."

"It might always seem like something is off with him, but this time it's different." As they approached the temple where Asinti had secluded himself, both Silver Star and Viira started to share his suspicions. Although the ponies and zebras they passed seemed normal, something about the place felt fundamentally wrong.\n    When they reached the temple entrance, a sudden cry for help stopped them in their tracks, a filly pleading to be lel go. Without a second thought, the trio rushed in. To their astonishment, inside the temple's main hall, a group of foals was running around, seemingly playing tag.\n    "I told you something was wrong," Leopold murmured, trying to spot their zebra friend.\n    "Looking for me?" Asinti came unexpectedly from behind them, causing Silver Star to jump.\n    "I must admit I was worried," Leopold responded, his worry now turning into apprehension.\n    See even your dear friends, think as I do. The voice whispered.\n    "Shush," Asinti muttered under his breath.\n    "Huh?" Leopold took a step back.\n    "Sorry," Asinti quickly apologized with a smile. "Why are you worried about, my friend?"\n    "Well, for one, you were..." Leopold started. "Never mind that. What's going on with all these foals? Did you open a community center or something?"\n    "You could say that," Asinti replied. This is so pathetic, you know that? The voice added, but he ignored it. "They had nowhere else to go... so I figured, why not here?"\n    The trio looked around, as confused as the moment they walked into this temple.\n    "Oh, I almost forgot, would you like something to drink?" Asinti asked with smile. "We could also plan to do something together soon. I've really started to enjoy hiking," he suggested, patting Leopold on the back. "A bit of exercise wouldn't hurt you or your wings, my friend."\n    Speechless and still processing the bizarre situation, they agreed and followed Asinti to get a drink, hoping it might help them understand their friend's mysterious behavior better."

He was so focused that he didn't notice Gąsienica, until he was casting a big shadow over the desk. Silver Star almost fell out of his chair when he saw him.\n    "Don't sneak up on me like that again!" he told Gąsienica audibly scared.\n    "I'll try to be louder next time, my lord," Gąsienica replied, bowing his head a little.\n    "Shouldn't you be asleep? It's really late," Silver Star said, glancing at the night sky outside.\n    "Not this week," Gąsienica answered. "What about you?"\n    Silver Star just smiled slightly. "Tonight's not a night for sleep."\n    Gąsienica looked intrigued, unusual notion for him. "Something wrong?" he asked.\n    Silver Star was hesitant at first. He usually kept his worries to himself, but he felt like he could trust Gąsienica. He pointed at an old book on his desk. "This," he said. "It's not just a book. It's full of dark magic secrets. I feel drawn to it, but..."\n    Gąsienica waited for him to continue.\n    "...I don't want to go back to who I was," Silver Star added. "I'm not sure if I have strength to  resist the temptation."\n    "You will," Gąsienica said confidently.\n    Silver Star was surprised by his assurance.\n    "I thought you were just another little pony that came here in lust of power, not holding anything dear except to himself except own ego. Wasn't wrong, weren't I?" Gąsienica explained. "But such creature doesn't risk their life for friends or show mercy for those like me."\n    "So, you think..." Silver Star began.\n    "You're stronger than you think," Gąsienica interrupted. "Strength isn't just about physical power. It's about what you do."\n    Silver Star listened, realizing the griffon might be right. He had always thought of strength in terms of magical power, but what was the use of it? Hiding away from the world? Then it hit him — he had heard these words before, from somepony very close to him, but in his pride, he had never truly listened."

He was occupied by his work until a sharp pain jolted him. Somecreature had pulled his tail. Annoyed, he swiftly pulled it in and turned around to see who interrupted him in such way.\n    "Finally, I've been here for five minutes," Viira said, grinning mischievously.\n    "You could've just said something," Leopold grumbled, leaning over the edge of his platform.\n    "That's exactly what I've been doing," she responded.

To break the ice, he invited both of them for dinner to spend some time together and chat a bit—and chat they did. For the past hour, they had been talking about seemingly random topics, but for some reason, half of them were connected to Silver Star. To say he felt uncomfortable would be an understatement, the amount of things he heard about himself during this dinner was more than he had heard in his entire life combined.\n    "Is everything alright, Silver?" asked White Star. "You seem quiet even for your standards, or is it just your girlfriend being so talkative that it only seems that way?"\n    Silver Star was swirling his glass in the air, not fully focused on the conversation. "No, no, everything is fi..." Then the second part of what his sister said struck him. "She is not... I'm not... WE are not together!" His glass nearly fell to the ground, but White Star caught it just in time with her magic. After a quick reflection, he turned towards Viira to see her reaction. It was easy to guess—she was laughing.\n    "If you say so," White Star let out a small laugh. "Oh, that reminded me of a story when Silver wanted to help the maids in our castle. Want to hear it?"\n    This time, nothing could prevent the glass from shattering across the floor. "Don't," was all Silver Star could manage to say as his eyes widened. But one look towards Viira shattered his hopes of not hearing the story, as she was nodding furiously with a big grin on her face. Silver Star began to wonder if there were any closets nearby he could hide in.\n    "As a colt, Silver always tried to help everybody around, which was most admirable of him," White Star began the story. "But when it came to helping our servants or, spirits forbid, peasants... Let's just say our parents did not share his enthusiasm." She sighed audibly, "But young Silver couldn't comprehend their reasons, so he tried to think what distinguished him from a common maid at the castle. In a display of innocence, he concluded that the only difference was their uniform." Viira's grin grew even larger, while Silver Star tried to hide his face under his hooves. "So, he went to them with a request to dress him like they were dressed," White Star continued. "And, of course, they did as the son of their master told them. I remember being so mad at myself for studying in the library that whole day and not being able to join this dress-up." She laughed a bit. "Then our Silver went around helping with everything his hooves allowed. It was when I went to the kitchen to grab something to eat that I saw him. It was one of the most adorable sights I've ever seen—my little brother in a maid uniform trying to make bread dough." White Star smiled. "It took a whole week to get all that flour out of his mane. Of course, neither Mom nor Dad were happy about it. When they found out, Silver was grounded for a month or so for what they called... meddling with the lesser." She sighed again, this time with much more sadness. "I still wonder how they found a dress so small that it somewhat fit him."\n    "Aww... That's adorable," Viira said, lowering her head to match Silver Star's, which currently rested on the table hidden under his hooves. "Why haven't you told me earlier that you're such a helpful unicorn?" All she heard in response were barely audible grunts. "But if you were so eager to help, then maybe you can help me with cleaning too?" Viira's grin somehow managed to widen even more. Hearing no other response, she added, "If it will help, I can get you a dress that will fit properly this time.""

  barrad_friendship_tree.37.d:0 "    It all happened so fast that Silver Star wasn't sure if it was reality or just a figment of his imagination. The scene replayed in his mind, waves of anomalous material cascading onto his head, moving too quickly for him to react. All he could do was watch and accept his fate... But a sharp, unpleasant sensation was pulling him out of this suspended state. Pain, again and again, until he finally snapped, "Do you need to pull it so hard?" he said, turning his head toward Viira.\n    "It's not my fault it's so tangled up," she responded, taking another stick from Silver Star's mane and tossing it aside. "Also, since when are you so sensitive?" Viira added, continuing to brush his hair.\n    "Since a ton of sticks and leaves dropped onto my head," Silver Star grumbled, turning his head to make Viira's work easier. "And then crashed into bottled 'tangling spell'. Who even thinks of crafting such a spell?"\n    Viira threw away a few more sticks. "Lucky you didn't break the bottle with the 'manual breathing spell'." Silver Star used his magic to pick up one of the many sticks lying around and poked Viira with it. She grabbed it and placed it back in his mane, next to his horn. "But thanks for coming to help me clean up this place. I really appreciate it."\n    Silver Star snapped the stick rivaling his horn in half. "I guess it's at least a different experience," he said with a heavy sigh.\n    "Hey, but at least you looked super cute in that dress... until the tangling accident. A shame I had to cut it to free you," Viira teased while still brushing his mane.\n    "You were supposed to not mention it if I came here to help you," he retorted, turning toward her.\n    "I was supposed to not mention the other thing, which I haven't until now," she said with a sly smile. "Now stop being a pouty princess and let me finish untangling your mane. Unless you want to brush it yourself?"\n    With a visible blush, Silver Star turned his head away. "When you're sleeping, I'm throwing that 'manual breathing spell' into your glass of water," he muttered.\n    "Good luck distinguishing it from another tangling spell," Viira chuckled."

  barrad_friendship_tree.39.d:0 "    The room echoed with loud knocking. No one answered. Silver Star knocked again. Silence. Growing worried, he pushed the door open. A dim candle flickered inside, casting shadows on the walls. Viira sat on the bed, staring into the flame. She hadn’t noticed him come in so he stepped closer.\n    “Hey...” Silver Star began, his voice soft. “Mind if I sit?” He paused at the edge of the bed, waiting. After a long silence, she nodded. He sat, leaving a wide gap between them. “Is everything alright?” he asked, though he already knew the answer.\n    “Nothing is,” she replied, turning toward him. Her eyes glimmered with an intensity he couldn’t place - fear, anger, sorrow? He wasn’t sure. “I... I don’t know what’s happening to me,” she whispered, leaning closer.\n    “What do you—” His heart raced as her eyes widened.\n    Suddenly, a knife gleamed in her hoof, its tip pointed at his throat. “Remember when I broke into your tower? You found me in your library,” she said, and not waiting for his response added. “Then I kissed you.” Her grin grew wild. “I wasn’t supposed to. I was supposed to stab you with this knife.” She waved it fur length from his skin.\n    Silver Star froze, panic gripping him. The knife hovered too close for him to move. He stayed silent, waiting, trapped by her will. “I saw that moment in a vision,” Viira continued, laughing to herself. “I’ve seen so much. Things you’d never believe.” The blade touched his throat now, a cold point pressing into his skin. “But now... I see nothing. No future, only now and the past.” Her grin faded. Her pupils shrank. Her hooves trembled giving him a tiny cut.\n    A drop of blood appeared. She gasped and let the knife fall, her eyes filling with tears. She collapsed on the bed, covering her head with her hooves, sobbing. Silver Star, still in shock, checked the cut—it was barely there, already drying.\n    He turned his attention to Viira. She lay curled up, still crying and muttering incoherently. Gently, he placed a hoof on her and began stroking her mane. “It’s alright,” he said softly. “You’re scared... so am I.” He sighed, continuing to brush her mane, not knowing what else to say.\n    They sat like that for a long time, Viira’s sobs slowly fading into silence. Finally, she raised her head and looked at him. “Nothing... I can’t see... can’t control,” she whispered.\n    Silver Star struggled for words. “I... You... There is...” He shook his head. “I don’t know.”\n    Viira’s voice, though weak, cut through his thoughts. “Yet you’re here,” she said. “Why?”\n    Caught off guard, Silver Star answered without thinking. “I felt like you might need somepony... to be here with you.” His words sounded foolish to his own ears.\n    Viira gazed at him, her expression softening. “And if I asked you to stay, would you?”\n    “Of course,” Silver Star said, without hesitation."

Rumors had reached them that cultists were attempting to regroup but had been scattered by an unknown force. Whether it was Gąsienica’s soldiers or locals defending their land, they didn't know.\n    Silver Star's ear twitched. "Someone's coming," he whispered, eyes fixed on the door.\n    The door opened and instead of awaited messenger a unicorn mare stepped inside. Her mane was fiery red, her fur purple. She wore a simple uniform stained with blood—some dried, some fresh. \n    "Who's in charge here?" she asked.\n    Asinti leaned back, studying her. "Introductions usually come before questions," he said calmly.\n    She blinked, then offered a slight smile. "Right. I'm Amber Aurora." She dipped her head, never breaking eye contact. "I came here with other brave souls to free the ponies of Barrad from Ambrosius's tyranny. We were ambushed, and I was captured."\n    Silver Star shifted uneasily, glancing at Asinti. The zebra noticed his friend was about to either say or do something stupid and spoke up. "How did you manage to escape?" he asked.\n    "Your soldiers helped," she replied. "While they fought my captors, I used the chaos to break free." She glanced down at her bloodied uniform. "I found some of them trying to regroup in the hills. I couldn't let that happen."\n    Asinti nodded slowly. "I see. And now you've come to us because...?"\n    "I want to help you free Barrad from its evil forces," she said, her horn beginning to glow softly. "It's the least I can do for those to whom I owe my life."\n    Silver Star swallowed, his voice barely above a whisper. "We can always use more help."\n    Asinti raised an eyebrow. "Generous of you. But why should we trust you?"\n    Amber Aurora met his gaze firmly. "Because otherwise, I would not have used the front doors."\n    A familiar voice rang in Asinti’s head: "I like her." He coughed loudly, trying to signal to Silver Star with his eyes, hoping that Silver Star would catch his intentions. "One last thing, you do realize who you are talking with?" the zebra said out loud.\n    "Do you think I'm so stupid that I would not recognize my queen's brother?" she replied."

The zebra finally glanced up, setting his papers aside. "It looks like the dumbest griffon I've ever met," he remarked dryly.\n    Leopold raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation flashing in his eyes. Before he could respond, Ambrosius chuckled without lifting his gaze from his writing. "You haven't met many griffons, have you?" he said to Asinti.\n    Slipping into his jacket Leopold muttered, "And they wonder why I don't like doctors."\n    Asinti leaned back in his chair, folding his hooves over his chest. "In all seriousness," he began, his voice taking on a more sincere tone, "what possessed you to implant so much... junk into your body?"\n    Leopold's eyes narrowed as he spread his wings wide. "Junk?!" he retorted sharply. He took a deep breath, visibly calming himself. "This is no ordinary junk. Without these, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now."\n    Ambrosius finally set down his quill, "But why not seek a solution through alchemy?" he said. "Someone talented could have found a remedy for your condition."\n    Leopold lowered his wings slowly, his gaze dropping to the floor. "I... I just tried to fix it on my own," he murmured, a rare note of vulnerability creeping into his voice. "Each new way of fixing myself had the potential to help all griffonkind... I was an idiot, wasn't I?"\n    "Not an idiot, Leopold," Asinti said gently. "Just..." He stared blankly at the wall. "Just... Too focused on your goals."\n    Ambrosius grinned, his eyes twinkling with renewed energy. "But I might have an idea how to put you back together. It might be a bit painful, though.""

  barrad_leopold.1.d:0 "    As he stood before the pulsing reactor, Leopold's feathers bristled in anticipation. The massive device positively radiated with crackling energy just begging to be harnessed, bathing the cavernous chamber housing it. Before moving any closer, he paused to reflect upon the life that had led him to this point. Once a sickly griffon, he was now on the cusp of wielding more power than any griffon in history! It was a lifetime of struggle that required inner strength, but he had refused to accept what nature had given him.\n    Leopold approached the reactor and its power began flowing through him, a trickle at first before morphing into a deluge. It was painful, at times feeling as if his body was being ripped apart, but he persevered. At last, the process was finished and Leopold emerged a changed creature. He was now a divine fusion of griffon and machine, stronger than ever before. Leopold felt like he could take on the world by himself. He had all the power he needed to create a new future for Griffonia. A better future, free from strife. He now felt volcano of emotions pushing him to persuit it. Yes, that future was now closer than ever before..."

Even if Count Ambrosius had been prepared enough to mount a defence, it would have been useless. As it was, both the Count and the Barradian nobility were busy wallowing in their hedonism and were blind to the ascension of Leopold. At least until he had broken down the door and Leopold was personally overseeing the termination of the Mad Count.\n    In a matter of days, thought terror he never though he was capable of inflicting, Ambrosius and his lackeys were either dead or too scared to act. Leopold was now the sole master of the nation, and he had the power to mold it however he wished. No longer would Barrad be mired in backwardness. It was the dawn of a new age."

  barrad_leopold.3.d:0 "    Leopold had a problem. Although the reactor had empowered him and made possible his enhanced form, the process remained incomplete. While most of his body now consisted of sturdy metal, some weak flesh remained. This served only as a reminder of the imperfection he had been cursed with. Fortunately, he had devised a procedure to remedy that situation.\n    As he laid down on the operating table, Leopold steeled himself for the first incision from the operating machine—another one of his creations. Once it began, the process was more painful than anything that Leopold had felt before, but he bore it all the same. It was simply the price of conquering nature. After the procedure was complete, Leopold rose from the table and flexed his mechanical claws. At last, he had done it. He was a griffon free from all mortality."

The beast was ferocious, but ultimately proved no match for Leopold's might. Once slain, the Titan's body provided a treasure trove of enchanted materials and technology to be salvaged. Leopold is now in a position to fully augment his body with armour composed of these materials, sturdier and more durable than any other alloy in this world. He is now truly unstoppable."

  barrad_leopold.7.d:0 "The machines marched in perfect unity, their hoofsteps blending together into a steady pounding against the metal floor below them. Leopold watched them silently, glee filling him at the sight. They were crude, for now, but they were moving under their own power, and they would fight.\n\nMost of the clockworks were the simple model, an adequate machine at best, but one easily manufactured and replaced. Expendability was a virtue of its own after all, and these were expendable like few others.\n\nStill, he found the second generation clockworks much more appealing in so many ways. They stood taller, had stronger armor and moved faster as well as with greater precision. They were an actual threat one on one, even if not quite as deadly as he'd have wanted them to be. Naturally, the production costs skyrocketed, but that was the price of quality.\n\nThe last models though, were his pride and joy. They moved with a fluid grace that set them apart from the pure constructs, and their mechanical eyes scanned the environment, actually aware of their surroundings. They understood the world around them much better than any of the simpler clockworks, and they would be able to actively command the lesser clockworks in battle. Alas, it was a shame that he had not figured out how to make a true artificial intelligence, and that for now he had to cheat by binding a mortal soul into the machines. Then again, considering the lesser clockworks could be produced en masse, he had sacrifices to spare now."

  barrad_leopold.8.d:0 "    Leopold wandered through what had once been the most sacred halls of the cult. He wasn't feeling well. Though his body felt much stronger, his mind was slipping away. Despite all his work and sacrifice, he was still so far from perfection. Maybe these ancient halls hid long-forgotten secrets that could help him.\n    As he stood before the gate to the room that once hosted the ancient god, he noticed something. The decorations on the walls were not just random symbols. They looked like mathematical equations, but using symbols unknown to him.\n    Days passed, and all he had were piles of notes and no answers. This was not a single equation but a series of them. While some symbols were easy to decode—since the values behind them followed known rules—others made no sense to Leopold. Yet he was sure it was a mathematical problem, perhaps unsolved and without a clear purpose to him yet. But he knew it wouldn't be located in such a place if it didn't hold any value. He just needed somegriff who could help him."

He wasn't the oldest mathematics professor in Gamia, but he had seen a thing or two in his lifetime. Yet this—this was beyond anything he had ever imagined. Not only had he been kidnapped by a group of lunatics, but now he was being forced to solve some made-up equations.\n    "Father was right," he muttered under his breath. "Stick to classical math, it'll be of some use." Now he found himself trapped underground, all because these zealots thought that surreal mathematics had something to do with actual surreal phenomena. They seemed oblivious to his suggestion to consult a fortune teller, after all, they would get as much useful information from a crystal ball as from him on this nonsense.\n    "Maybe if I play along," Riegriff thought, "I can find a way out of this mess." Perhaps these equations were indeed written in some forgotten notation. If he could decipher them, he might not only appease his captors but also gain access to resources for his actual research.\n    Hours blurred together as he delved deeper into the labyrinth of unknown symbols. Frustration gnawed at him, but so did fascination. It was both utter nonsense but clearly followed most of math rules and exceptions he knew about. But the more he delved into it the more he felt like it was not written by creature that thinks in same way as him… or any other living.\n    "Maybe this isn't complete gibberish," Riegriff admitted to himself.

Flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows on the walls, where fragments of equations and hastily scribbled notes formed a chaotic tapestry that enveloped whole room.\n    His once meticulous handwriting had devolved into illegible scrawls. Symbols looped into one another, creating endless spirals that pulled him deeper into an abyss of confusion. He muttered incessantly, each word spilling from his lips like a fevered chant.\n    Grabbing a quill with a trembling claw, he dipped it into an inkwell but knocked it over instead. Black ink pooled across the table, seeping into his papers. He stared at the spreading stain, eyes wide. Instead of cursing, he began to write on the spilled ink itself, his quill scratching furiously over the dark surface.\n    As he continued wrestling with the equations, the room spun around him. It was hunger, but he stopped paying mind to it long time ago. Food just like sleep it had become a distant memory, an unnecessary distraction. The symbols had invaded his mind. They danced not only in hes eyes but also in his ears, morphing into shapes that defied logic. He saw patterns in everything, the cracks in the stone walls, the way the candle flames flickered, even the constellations he had ordered to map onto a giant chart.\n    He stopped writing abruptly, eyes fixed on a particular symbol on the wall. It seemed to call to him with a silent song. He approached slowly, reaching out to trace it with a trembling talon.\n    "The answer," he breathed. "But what was the question?" he mumbled. "One constant in all... forty and four."\n    Frustration boiled in him. With a loud shout, he swept his arm across the table, sending parchments, quills, and candlesticks crashing to the floor. Breathing heavily, he sank to his knees. "But perhaps..."\n    "Perhaps," he murmured, a strange calm washing over him. "To solve the unsolvable, one must embrace the irrational."\n    He looked again at the symbol he had examined before. "Yes, yes... if we would... of course." He grabbed one of the quills from the ground. "I just need to reduce this constant. It's all clear now..."\n    He gazed intently at the quill. "Reduce by exactly..." With a sudden, decisive motion, Riegriff stabbed his eye with the quill. "One," he whispered, as he collapsed onto the scattered papers."

After all, sometimes before you can create something new, you need to destroy something old... If only they would drop the mysticism and focus on following his orders.

"That's one way of putting it."\n    Leopold turned around, his metal wing inadvertently breaking the window in the process. "Is something wrong? You know you can always tell me the truth."\n    A voice resonated in Asinti's head. "Yes... do tell him the truth. Say how pathetic this god-wannabe has become. And when his blood starts to boil..." The zebra suddenly felt uncertain. "Just as we planned, you will give the signal for your followers to fire." Asinti glanced toward the shattered window. Not far away, a modified anti-tank gun was aimed directly at them. All he needed was to keep the griffon in front of the window a bit longer and toss the flare potion hidden under his cloak.\n    "Actually, there is something," Asinti spoke after a moment. "You."\n    "What do you mean?" Leopold stood as if petrified.\n    "Just look at you—a little bird in a giant metal cage," Asinti's voice sounded unlike his usual self; it was eerie. "Playing with your toys. Who are you fooling? Your followers or yourself, thinking you can hold the mantle of emperor... oh, sorry, god-emperor." He bowed slightly. "Tell me, is your ego finally satisfied now that there's nocreature left to question your ideas?" The zebra grasped the flask beneath his coat. "It only took entombing yourself in armor for somecreature to even listen to you."\n    Leopold stood motionless, anger rising within him. To question his methods—fine. To question his actions—acceptable. But to question the ideas he'd sacrificed his whole life for was too much. He tried with all his might to calm himself, but something deep inside urged him otherwise. His internal battle lasted so long that he didn't notice the bright flash of light behind him. What he did notice was the powerful blow to his back that drove him to the ground.\n    "You're one durable beast," Asinti grinned. "Don't worry," he said, leaping onto Leopold with another potion in his hoof. "I have something to finish this." But before he could act, he felt himself suddenly lifted into the air. In the blink of an eye, Leopold had stood up and grabbed him by the neck.\n    Before Asinti could think of anything to do, a loud snap echoed through the room. His body fell to the floor, and together with it, Leopold collapsed to his knees."

His frustration grew with every obstacle. After bumping into yet another low-hanging beam, he'd had enough. In a moment of fury, he grabbed a table that stood in his way and hurled it aside. Chairs, sofas, bookshelves—everything unfortunate enough to be within reach of his claws—went flying along with it.\n    As he reached for yet another piece of furniture—a wooden closet—he noticed something move inside. Curious, he lowered it gently and opened its doors. Inside lay Silver Star, curled up and shivering.\n    "Here you are. I was looking for you," said Leopold, his voice metallic with tone of irritation.\n    "H-H-Hi!" Silver Star stammered. "N-n-n-need something?"\n    "I just wanted to thank you for your help," Leopold said, setting the closet down carefully. "Both with overseeing the excavations and the reactor. I'm not sure if I already said so."\n    "T-t-t-that's n-n-no problem," Silver Star replied, raising his head a little.\n    "Is something wrong?" Leopold asked, looking down at his friend. "Want to go somewhere and talk?"\n    "NO!" the unicorn yelled. "I-I-I mean," he began to stammer again, "no need. I'm just worried about, uh... things we might find during the excavation."\n    "Diligent as always," Leopold remarked. He placed a claw on Silver Star's head; it seemed bigger than the rest of his body. "I'll leave you to your work then," he said, stroking his mane in a gentle manner. "Take care of yourself," he added before walking toward the doors."

  barrad_leopold.14.d:0 "    To his surprise, Barrad was home not only to creatures living above the ground. Deep beneath the surface, cultists in whom Viira was particularly interested were surely planning how to mess with his plans. Leopold could not allow it; even just the thought of some dirty, superstitious creatures being able to slow or stop his plans made his blood boil.\n    Not leaving them any chance, he went through all the info Viira had gathered about them and began to look for their headquarters. It took some time, but he finally found them. Without showing any mercy, he fought his way down until he stood in front of a giant decorated gate. It seemed odd—otherworldly and eerie. With each step closer, he felt an unsettling presence attempting to penetrate his mind, but the more it tried to invade his thoughts, the angrier he grew.\n    With the fury of a thunderstorm, he smashed through the gate. What he saw beyond would have driven an ordinary griffon to madness, but Leopold was no longer ordinary. In that moment, he was the embodiment of wrath, and the entity before him sought to get into his mind."

  barrad_leopold.15.d:0 "\n    Gebléod, together with her most devoted followers, undertook a dangerous quest. She wanted to get closer to the new incarnation of their god, so she decided to search his sacred rooms, hoping they could find something that would let them know him better. They moved with caution, as, just like with the old machine god, his halls were scattered with divine machinery whose purpose they did not know. Searching through what appeared to be an altar decorated with machine parts, she found a book—an obviously divine object. Gebléod quickly concluded that it had to be written by him. Upon completing prayers and with her followers chanting the song of the divine machine, she dared to open it. The sensation upon reading the holy words washed over her like the day she was shown the sacred truth of the machine god. Most of it was written in symbols she did not understand, and what she could read was beyond her comprehension.\n    Yet she stumbled upon scripture about the so-called “Griffon Empire” and the plans their god had for it. It was clear to her what had to be done; even if not spoken directly, the will of god would be executed. They just needed to gather more information about this."

I already told you, I'm Silver Star," the unicorn responded, taking a loud sip from his cup of tea.\n    Riegriff looked at him, unsure if the unicorn was playing or genuinely that clueless. "But what is your role here? Why are you sitting with me right now?"\n    A moment of realization struck Silver Star. "My role? I’m… I was… I hope I was Leopold’s friend." He lowered his head. "That was before I helped build that cursed reactor. He was different back then. Did you know him before too?"\n    An unexpected flood of memories brought a small smile to Riegriff’s face. "Yes, I did, back in Gamia," he began. "He was the only true genius I know who got kicked out of the university."\n    "He never mentioned that part," Silver Star said, taking another loud sip.\n    A quiet laugh echoed through the ancient halls. "No wonder he hasn't mentioned it. The Department of Chemistry and Biology filed so many complaints about him, it's still a record."\n    "But what did he do?" The unicorn moved closer, genuine curiosity in his eyes.\n    Riegriff chuckled. "To put it simply, he was really annoying," he looked around. "I didn't really pay much attention to that, as I was more than glad to help him with his math models."\n    Silver Star's mind was filled with all his social interactions. Maybe he was right all that time, each time he thought he might be an annoyance to somepony, it could end terribly. But as he was contemplating the possibilities of his past actions, Riegriff continued:\n    "But of course, that was not the main reason. There are plenty of annoying griffons at the university. But not many of them have such a talent for generating conflicts out of thin air," Riegriff laughed loudly. "And when, in the heat of debate, you resort to the argument of strength... I still remember the faces of others when Leopold started beating up the rector."\n    "He did what?" Silver Star sounded confused.\n    "Beat up the university rector," Riegriff repeated. "Using a big wooden ruler.""

  barrad_viira.17.t:0 "The Last Obstacle"
  barrad_viira.17.d:0 "    The reactor was pulsating in strange manner, emitting a spectacle beyond the comprehension of any mortal. Viira sat before it absorbing its immense power, enhancing her seer's abilities, though she had yet to master how to fully control it.\n    "Stop hiding, I see where you will be in a moment," Viira called out without looking back. "Be a good griffon and come out, don't make this harder than it has to be." She attempted to sound nonchalant, though her mind was clouded with unsettling visions of what could happen. True to her foresight, Gąsienica walked from the corridor, half of his feathers scorched and skin burned. "I didn't think you could get any uglier, but here you are," she turned to face him. "Have you come to bow before the new goddess of these lands?" Viira teased with a grin.\n    Silence hung heavily as Gąsienica slowly advanced, clearly in pain but propelled by sheer willpower. As he drew nearer, Viira got nervous. "You can bow now," she insisted, but Gąsienica kept on walking. Each of his steps thinned the possible outcomes, converging toward the one Viira dreaded most.\n    "I said, bow," she repeated, her voice tinged with desperation as the feared scenario was unfolding. In a panic, she unleashed a powerful word of magic, under a simple command "bow" power of this singular word echoed through the room, disrupting the delicate structure of magic and making the walls shake.\n    Gąsienica halted. He wanted to go forward, but his body and mind rebelled. His neck bending involuntarily. The strength he was using to raise his head up could tear apart pony or even bear, yet despite it his beak was inching closer to the ground. "Yes, my lady," he murmured.\n    Viira, startled by the unintended strength of her spell, pondered its potential. Focusing on Gąsienica, she released another surge of magic. The griffon screamed, as he tried to keep his posture intact. "What did you call me?" she asked.\n    "My lady," he gasped between jolts of pain.\n    "That's not how I introduced myself," Viira corrected sharply.\n    "I'm sorry... My goddess," Gąsienica responded."
  barrad_viira.17.a:0 "Was it so hard?"
  barrad_viira.16.t:0 "The End?"
  barrad_viira.16.d:0 "    The air was buzzing with magical energy, in it rocks and boulders floated like stars on the night sky. At the center of this chaotic storm was Viira. She wasn’t standing in one place—no, standing wasn’t the right word at all. She was rapidly teleporting from point to point, but it wasn’t the smooth, controlled teleportation of a unicorn. Viira's movements were violent, jarring, as if her very being was torn and stitched together in an endless loop.\n    From a safe distance, Gąsienica watched in silent dread. He was not one to fear much, but this — this — was beyond him. The world around seemed to tear itself apart from the powers that engulfed Viira, and Gąsienica dared not interfere. The air got filled with strange patterns weaving themselves into the atmosphere like cracks in the fabric of reality.\n    Viira's screamed in her thoughts, “More, I demand more.” She searched for a reply, for the familiar presence that whispered in her mind. Silence. "I COMMAND YOU!" Viira’s scream shattered the quiet, and the air itself seemed to tear apart.\n    And then it came—faint at first, like the flickering of dying embers, the voice of the Machine God echoed in her mind, distorted, fragmented: "We... I... cannot." The voice, a cacophony of different tones, like a discordant melody sung by thousands of flickering lights. "Your... body... cannot..."\n    Blood boiled in Viira’s veins. "You will not tell me what I can and cannot do." The ground beneath her trembled as she spoke.\n    “We... You... can... just... need... not follow... our mistake,” the Machine God’s voice fractured, as if pleading, but something deeper lay beneath the chaos. “Just... let go..."\n    In that very moment, clarity struck Viira. All this time, she had held herself back, tethering her power to her fragile, mortal body, fearing what it would do, fearing the toll it would take. But it was the flesh, not lack of power, that held her back. All she needed was to…\n    Let go.\n    The thought seized her. In the next moment, the pain vanished. Hunger, thirst, the cold wind that had once brushed against her mane—all of it faded. She felt nothing, yet everything. She was beyond flesh.\n    From below, Gąsienica saw her flicker one final time. Then, she was gone. Without thinking, he ran to where she had been, dodging falling rocks. But when he reached the spot, there was nothing. No sign of her.\n    Yet, she was there. He could feel her, like heat after a flame dies. He didn’t know what had happened, but he knew one thing:"

  barrad_viira.19.t:0 "Art of Necromancy"
  barrad_viira.19.d:0 "    Despite her best efforts, Viira’s eyes kept drooping, closing after every two sentences she managed to read. The old, dusty tomes Silver Star had collected over the years were filled with knowledge and potential power, yet they were written as if boredom itself were the key to guarding their secrets. Maybe that’s why necromancers and their ilk are so obsessed with eternal life, she mused. It would take at least three lifetimes and two deaths from boredom to get through all of this.\n    Frustrated, Viira swept the grimoire aside and let her forehead smack against the desk. As she rubbed her temples, something familiar caught her eye - a book spine she had seen before. Unsure if it was what she thought, she walked over to the shelf and pulled it down.\n    Opening the cover, her suspicion was confirmed. "Silver Star’s sketchbook," she whispered to herself.\n    Flipping through the pages, she noticed that each sketch was signed with a date. That sparked an idea. She quickly ran through to the day when Leopold had nearly taken the sketchbook from Silver Star by force. When she reached the pages, a small smile tugged at her lips.\n    The two pages formed a single, sprawling sketch - a fight scene. Asinti and Leopold lay on the ground, seemingly wounded, while she knelt nearby, in awe, with tears streaming down her face. At the center of the action stood Gąsienica, drawn even larger than his already imposing size, locked in battle with Silver Star. The unicorn was positioned between the giant griffon and the others, his stance one of fierce protection, while in the background, hooded figures cheered on the chaos.\n    Viira shut the sketchbook with a snap, a single tear rolled down her cheek. She muttered under her breath:"

Expanding her realm alone won't satisfy her hunger for power — no, the ungrateful creatures will still defy her. Conquest by the sword is only the first step; to truly dominate, her voice must resonate across new lands, weaving the same melody thats sings in minds of her loyal subjects. Their head must be filled with her influence, bending to their new purpose. But even Viira must tread carefully—such a task, even for a goddess, demands caution."

  #only first and last needs to be written
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_flavor1:0 "Leopold had a point, taking notes is definitely more practical. What kind of looser carry around a bulky journal all the time anyway?\n\nHopefully, I'll come across something noteworthy soon.\n\n\n\nP.S. I need to investigate anomaly that swallowed my journal."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text1:0 "The Count called us all together for another one of his ridiculous feasts, and afterwards forced us to go on a hunting expedition in the forest. Things were quite dull until we stumbled upon the schematics for a mysterious device. Asinti wanted custody of the ponies that led us to them, the fool, but I ensured that did not happen.\n\nClearly, further investigation into the origin of these schematics will be necessary. Contacting the cult that provided them would be a good place to start."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text2:0 " After questioning members of this cult, I discovered that they believe the schematics originate from the deity they worship. This calls for further questioning into the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text3:0 "The deity cultists worship, the "Great Machine". Quite curious. Contacting Inner Circle cultists will be necessary to discover more about the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text4:0 "After contacting the Inner Circle cultists, I received a very strange vision, possibly from their deity. The vision seemed to indicate that it was withering away and in need of something. What kind of god needs something from mortals?"

While there I met an interesting griffon with a magical trinket which he used to protect the villages. I studied the trinket and the warding spell he cast, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text7:0 " Asinti was grateful enough to provide me with samples of living rock he stumbled upon while constructing his absurd temple. This rock seems to have a will of its own. Quite bizarre..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text8:0 "I feel more confident in making a link between the living rock and the hostile plants. The two are connected, but what power could be behind the corruption of the very earth? I am at a loss."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text9:0 "Perhaps the answers I seek lie beneath the ground? I hear Leopold is conducting quite the excavation..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text10:0 "The Titan of living rock uncovered by Leopold's excavation was obviously a magical construct, but creating it would be well beyond the ability of any living mage. It must have been the same power behind Asinti's living rock and the plants that attacked the mountain villages. It's all connected, I know it, but how? I just need to find one more missing piece... Silver Star's library is the only place in Barrad that might contain answers, but I doubt he would ever let me peruse it voluntarily."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text11:0 "Everything now seems much more clear, the time draws near..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_friendship:0 "Lately, I've been experiencing strange feelings. Those individuals I've been spending time with... I've become quite attached to them. Is it possible that I've started to care about them?\n\No, I can't let these feelings distract me. I must remain committed to my true path."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text12:0 "So it is done. What was once a god now lies under my hoof as a slave, with me ascending to its former position. It's unfortunate that others couldn't accept it.\n\nYet despite the vast powers I've acquired, there remain places beyond my grasp, such as mind  of the cultist's god. Perhaps, by constructing additional reactors, I might find a way to access it?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text13:0 "Yes, yes, yes! I can sense an even greater power flowing through my flesh. It's an exhilarating sensation! Even surpassing the joy I get from sensing ancient entity's fear.\n\nIt's time to teach it that no secrets can be kept from me."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text14:0 "Most fascinating, the entity comprises seven distinct consciousnesses. Yet, these separate entities come together to form a single, unified mind. What a remarkable phenomenon.\n\nThe one I succeeded in accessing revealed to me visions of cities gleaming with gold and rivers flowing with milk and honey. It became apparent that these were not just visions but manifestations of its desires and envy.\n\nCould such promises help me draw more followers while I'll be acquiring power?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text15:0 "Accessing the second consciousness proved to be a more challenging task. It contained vast knowledge but was fiercely protected by a level of greed surpassing that of any griffon or dragon.\n\nDespite the obstacles, it now lies exposed before me, akin to an open book, and I intend to explore its contents thoroughly."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text16:0 "The only word that aptly describes this consciousness is wrath, starkly different from the others. I wonder, has it always been driven by a desire for pain and destruction? Or did it, at some point, become aware of its own potential?\n\nMuch like I have now..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text17:0 "I once believed I understood what of joy and pleasure is, but I was mistaken. The third consciousness inundated me with visions of pure ecstasy, igniting a lust for more.\n\nHowever, I saw through its allure. As tempting as it is to indulge in such pleasures, this experience showed me the importance of not succumbing too easily to the desires of the flesh, reminding me to maintain clarity of thought."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text18:0 "This consciousness exhibits significant diligence and takes pride in its accomplishments. While it's somewhat boring, there's value in self-praise. Fortunately, I can leave the hard work part to others."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text19:0 "It's surprising how creature so powerful can become so indifferent and apathetic.\n\nI must ensure that neither I nor my followers ever find ourselves in a similar condition."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text20:0 "This consciousness would explain  Ambrosius' actions, dominated by hedonistic desires and an insatiable appetite for magic. It's unfortunate it never found a way to quench its thirst for power like I did.\n\nIt makes me wonder if I could use my abilities in reverse to create physical objects on a large scale.\n\nP.S. There has to bo something more I can put into my hooves!"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text21:0 "I barely feel my own flesh anymore, but there is no turning back. I must venture further, even if it means leaving the mortal realm."
