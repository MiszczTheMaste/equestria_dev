  BAR_friend_ignite_reactor_desc:0 "Our path forward is unobstructed, and we shall proceed with our plans towards reactor. If the gods harbor any concern for us mere mortals, may their watchful eyes be upon us.."
  BAR_friend_meet_ambrosius_desc:0 "The Mad Count has awoken from what seemed to be an eternal slumber, but he changed. No more do his halls resound with maniacal laughter and hedonistic revelry, instead his voice now beared the tones of reason. And he seeks an audience."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_desc:0 "Merely fending off cultist assaults and raids is a futile endeavor. We must seize the initiative and confront them on their own territory, maintaining relentless pressure."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_mountains_desc:0 "Within our mountains lies countless underground structures, whether formed naturally, excavated by diamond dogs, or shaped by other forces. If these depths harbor cultists, we must either subdue them or entomb all within beneath layers of unyielding rock.."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_elysium_desc:0 "Elysium the largest city in Barrad, harbors a subtle cultist enclave. While not overtly violent, this cell engages in covert acts of sabotage and other clandestine activities that elude our knowledge. It demands our decisive intervention."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_roughers_desc:0 "The eastern forests are great for two purposes, concealing and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Barrad. Both we and the cultists are well aware of this, emphasizing the need to thwart their covert operations."
  BAR_friend_occupy_grand_sanctuary_desc:0 "The grand sanctuary evokes the most unsettling feelings. The last encounter Pentarchy and Gąsienica had within its sacred halls involved a battle to liberate Ambrosius. Yet, upon departing, a lingering sense that something crucial had been overlooked has persisted to this very day. Now, they are compelled to rectify it..."
  BAR_friend_enemies_without_desc:0 "We find ourselves inadequately equipped for the impending conflict, yet it will come, whether we desire it or not. Perhaps launching an offensive against our adversaries before they amass greater power than us is the best option we have."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_desc:0 "It is beyond doubt that our southern neighbor will inevitably launch an assault. Observing the rapid expansion of their industrial might, it would be wiser to engage in conflict sooner rather than later."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_bonus_desc:0 "We must press forward, in the face of potential defeat, the cost becomes inconsequential."
  BAR_friend_convert_factories_desc:0 "Our resources are primarily tailored for internal conflicts. We must maximize their utility to the fullest extent possible for the incoming war."
  BAR_friend_seize_factories_desc:0 "Barrad harbors weapon manufacturers, predominantly catering to the black market in other nations. To stand any chance against external threats, we must seize control of their enterprises."
  BAR_friend_employ_mercenaries_desc:0 "Despite Gąsienica's disdain for mercenaries, numerous groups operate in our region, and undoubtedly those recruits will prove useful."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_desc:0 "Austurland's intentions remain uncertain, but Gąsienica believes that abandoning them would leave our flank vulnerable in the event of a potential conflict with the River Federation. It appears we must take a gamble..."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_bonus_desc:0 "Our current predicament has turned us into cornered animals, and so we must embrace that essence. With all of its ferocity."
  BAR_friend_fortify_border_desc:0 "Having secured our southern border, the imperative now lies in fortifying the western frontier to dissuade any potential invasions. May it allow us to focus our efforts on any potential threat from Riverlands."
  BAR_friend_light_of_the_star_desc:0 "In recent weeks, a cascade of unforeseen events unfolded. In his mastery of the unpredictable, Ambrosius seized the opportunity to introduce yet another layer of the unexpected. For better or worse, it is to be seen."
  BAR_friend_prince_of_wittenland_desc:0 "Much to his surprise, the ponies of Barrad responded positively upon learning that Silver Star had assumed leadership of the county. Perhaps they harbor hopes of a reunion with Wittenland, or maybe their trust is placed in the belief that he would govern akin to his sister."
  BAR_friend_letter_to_sister_desc:0 "Silver Star summoned the necessary courage to start writing a letter to his sister, a gesture that piqued the curiosity of certain deer."
  BAR_friend_fight_for_friendship_desc:0 "Even in the darkest recesses of his nightmares, Silver Star never envisioned the prospect of losing someone dear to him. Until now, he hadn't deemed anyone worthy of risking his life for. Yet, an unfamiliar power surges through his veins, filling him with determination to fight for the sake of his friends"
  BAR_friend_move_to_wittenburgh_desc:0 "Even with the Wittenland crown secured, our Riverland neighbors understandably still harbor suspicions about us. Perhaps relocating to Wittenburgh could dispell the notion of us being mere invaders and fostering trust."
  BAR_friend_serving_justice_desc:0 "Silver Star has learned how forgive for many transgressions, yet sororicide stands resolute outside the bounds of pardon. Unfortunately for those in Wittenland, he has also acquired the art of confronting challenges and not evading the responsibility"
  BAR_friend_homecoming_desc:0 "Victory is ours; the interlopers have been expelled from Wittenland. Now is the moment to unfurl the banner of three crowns across the lands."
  BAR_friend_river_federation_membership_desc:0 "Our circumstances are curious, for Wittenland long stood as a member of the River Federation. With our newfound rule, does this entitle us to membership as well? We must find out."
  BAR_friend_viira_and_silver_diplomacy_desc:0 "Silver Star found himself ill-prepared for the multifaceted challenges of governance, with diplomacy proving to be a particularly formidable adversary. Fortunately, no obstacle exists that cannot be overcome with the support of a friend."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff_desc:0 "Even united both Wittenland and Barrad lacked the economic prowess observed in the nations to the far west. Perhaps we could ask for some assistance?"
  BAR_friend_evi_griffons_diplomacy_desc:0 "Despite the well-known tensions between Wittenland and the griffons in the west, and Silver Star's personal reservations towards them, it seems imperative to extend a symbolic gesture of friendship in an effort to thaw the icy relations."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff2_desc:0 "Neither Viira nor Silver Star possess extensive experience in the realm of business, but everypony has to begin somewhere as securing foreign investments could significantly benefit us."
  BAR_friend_diplomacy_getting_somebody_competent_desc:0 "Despite their earnest intentions and best efforts, the two friends found themselves empty-hoofed after their diplomatic endeavor. Fortunately, there are more seasoned individuals just waiting to be called upon for assistance."
  BAR_friend_riverlands_diplomacy_desc:0 "Ambrosius appeared genuinely surprised that it took Silver Star this long to seek his assistance. Though when he was his age, he likely preferred spending time with mares rather than a leader of a rogue state."
  BAR_friend_merchant_dynasty_desc:0 "Ambrosius' immense fortune was not meticulously built from scratch; he inherited it, just as his father did before him, and countless others in his lineage. Each sought to pass on more than they received, and Ambrosius emerged as perhaps the shrewdest among them all."
  BAR_friend_one_hoof_washes_the_other_desc:0 "To get something from somepony, you must present an enticing offer aligned with their desires. However, exercise caution not to overtly reveal your intentions, for that might prompt them to demand more. It's a rather straightforward principle, wouldn't you agree, my young friend?"
  BAR_friend_buy_our_stuff_desc:0 "Barrad harbors abundant untapped resources that could serve as a valuable asset. Our endeavor should focus on securing potential buyers to feed into our burgeoning industrial pursuits."
  BAR_friend_silver_tongue_desc:0 "Ambrosius possesses exceptional gifts, and among them, his extraordinary social skills stand out. There is no being in existence with whom he cannot initiate a conversation, delving deep until a profound acquaintance is established."
  BAR_friend_regional_interventionism_desc:0 "To everypony's surprise, White Star was not only willig to assist her brother in ruling after losing her crown but also exhibited enthusiasm for the role. Perhaps shedding the constraints of monarchy played a part, or she simply reveled in the return of her sibling. Regardless, she advised adopting a more proactive stance in regional diplomacy, acknowledging that blood had already been spilled."
  BAR_friend_conquer_steppe_desc:0 "Those steppe griffons are impervious to reason. We need a swift resolution to prevent any future raids into our lands."
  BAR_friend_aproach_cossacs_desc:0 "As the government shifts on the steppe, an opportunity arises to cultivate alliances and safeguard our heartland from potential raids."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_deal_desc:0 "Grifofns in Gryphus always were well wersed in buissness, they surely will understand importance of cooperation between our countries for our mutual security and potentialy proserity."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_not_for_long_desc:0 "Gryphus looms as a potantial threat, demanding our attention before it spirals beyond control. Surprisingly, there is a measure of support for this prospective invasion, particularly among Ambrosius' feathered friends from the southern moutains."
  BAR_friend_bandits_and_communists_desc:0 "Communist uprisings, erratic rulers, famine. By venturing into those lands, we extend a favor to the griffons. Simultaneously, we thwart a looming threat to our region."
  BAR_friend_lushi_ultimatum_desc:0 "The gateway to absolute peace in Evi Valley lies in the small nation of Lushi. A diplomatic approach to persuade them to join our cause is advisable. However, it must be made explicitly clear that rejecting our proposal will carry significant consequences."
  BAR_friend_bring_order_to_helquil_desc:0 "Our attention seldom graced that distant realm. Yet, as our sphere of influence extended to this place forsaken by spirits, intervention became imperative."
  BAR_friend_ruin_has_come_desc:0 "Ruin has come to Barrad. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed lands. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth as we were spreading the realm of death and madness! But it can be reclaimed from the ravenous clutching shadows, rebuild into new house, opulent and imperial."
  BAR_friend_now_what_desc:0 "The mantle of rulership rests uneasy on Silver Star's shoulders, a responsibility he never envisioned. Amidst the recent tumultuous events, he finds himself adrift and overwhelmed. Fortunately, steadfast friends stand ready to guide him through the uncharted waters."
  BAR_friend_2_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy's reign, strength dictated supremacy - a simplistic rule leading to inevitable chaos when the strongest vanished. It becomes imperative to forge new societal structure, one rooted in collaboration rather than fear."
  BAR_friend_3_desc:0 "Despite the turmoil, the inhabitants of Barrad share more common ground than they realize. With the alleviation of constant fear and strugge for basic resources, it becomes imperative for them to rekindle the sense of unity they have seemingly forgotten."
  BAR_friend_4_desc:0 "Collaboration holds its merit, but it was trust that steered Pentarchy away from its dark course. This invaluable lesson gradually permeates the understanding of the common ponies too."
  BAR_friend_5_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad diligently toil, liberated from oppressive rule, banditry, and cultist influence. They rebuild infrastructure, rejuvenate trade, and witness the resurgence of circulated goods."
  BAR_friend_6_desc:0 "When working together we can exchange not only what we need to survive but also ideas that comes to our mind. It seems live two sided sword considering that cooperation between pentarchs focused on building a reactor leaded to time of strive, but it also holds much potential for good."
  BAR_friend_7_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad have proven to be remarkably innovative, perhaps driven by the scarcity of basic resources. With the elimination of survival concerns, their ingenuity can now be harnessed for more constructive purposes."
  BAR_friend_8_desc:0 "Having savored the fruits of prosperity and freedom, our populace will not relinquish them without a fight. To meet the demand for self-defense, numerous new arms manufacturers have commenced their operations."
  BAR_friend_first_census_desc:0 "Asinti harbors ambivalent sentiments about the situation they find themselves in. On one hoof, he yearns to place his trust in his friend Silver Star and the purported transformation within him. On the other, he grapples with the realization that they are inadvertently perpetuating a broken system he had sworn to dismantle. The notion of a census might serve as a feeble pretext, yet it stands as a potential means to quell the disquieting thoughts that assail him."
  BAR_friend_country_side_census_desc:0 "Silent and mostly serene, the fields and hills of Barrad provide an ideal sanctuary for contemplation, where one can ruminate on past actions and deliberate upon the course of future endeavors."
  BAR_friend_infrastructure_desc:0 "Traveling from settlement to settlement posed a perpetual challenge in Barrad, unless for those with wings. Asinti pondered why local communities couldn't unite to address this issue, constructing roads and bridges for their collective benefit. The notion lingered prominently in Asinti's mind."
  BAR_friend_many_cultures_of_barrad_desc:0 "Traversing the hilltops of Barrad left Asinti and his followers in awe of similarities and subtle distinctions among the various communities. Despite the pervasive influence of cultist beliefs in this region, the diversity observed proved both unsettling and inspiring, showcasing resilience amid the challenging circumstances faced by these inhabitants."
  BAR_friend_common_undestanding_desc:0 "Despite their long stay in Barrad, encountering a zebra remained an extraordinary event for most locals. Consequently, as they traveled, Asinti and his followers found themselves frequently sought after for assistance or guidance. Word spread from village to village, gradually turning the attention of many towards the striped preacher and his teachings for the common folk."
  BAR_friend_visit_in_asinti_temple_desc:0 "Lately Asinti has exhibited a noticeable change. He dedicates more hours to his temple, engages in fewer conversations, and wanders about contemplating. We should investigate the nature of his activities within the temple."
  BAR_friend_clockwork_asisted_work_desc:0 "Lot of workon the countryside is manual labor. Asinti suggested to Leopold that they could change it using his clockwork machines."
  BAR_friend_land_reclamation_desc:0 "Much of the labor in rural Barrad involves manual toil. Asinti proposed to Leopold the prospect of transforming this scenario through the utilization of his clockwork machines."
  BAR_friend_anti_anomaly_work_desc:0 "In a realm rife with magical anomalies, the term "normal life" loses its meaning. Asinti recognizes the challenge it poses for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of magic. He believes it's his duty not to abandon these people in their struggle against such formidable issues."
  BAR_friend_civ_industry_desc:0 "Having traversed the lands, Asinti couldn't dismiss the plight of the ponies enduring subpar conditions in Barrad. Enlisting the aid of his friends, he contemplates orchestrating community-driven construction initiatives to elevate the standards of housing."
  BAR_friend_mil_industry_desc:0 "As Asinti tells his stories of the struggle for freedom and the imperative of emancipation thought strenght of a unit, a curious development transpires: the common ponies starts enlarging  previously estabilished local militias. Like mushrooms sprouting after rainfall, fresh factories emerge to satiate this burgeoning appetite for strenght."
  BAR_friend_dev_up_desc:0 "Asinti couldn't recall the last time he felt a genuine sense of accomplishment. He perpetually pursued an elusive ideals, a spirit that defied capture the closer he approached. How many beings did he overlook in his relentless pursuit? Some of the zebras who come with him to Griffonia now had fillies, and even grand-fillies. He used to cherish them, took care of the young, aid those in need... now he can't even remember their names. Battling his inner demons, Asinti began to undestand the true nature of the tragedy he got himself into. But there is still time and hope, as long as you have friends by your side."
  BAR_friend_barradian_academy_of_applied_science_desc:0 "Leopold refused to surrender his lifelong obsession easily. Despite Silver Star's rejection of the proposal to reconstruct the reactor and ascend to the divine status akin to alicorn princesses in the distant west, Leopold resolved to explore alternative avenues to achieve his objective. Perhaps taking a step back was essential, assembling proficient individuals from Barrad and beyond might kindle a fresh spark of inspiration."
  BAR_friend_electrical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Electricity briefly captivated Leopold, as he speculated on its immense potential, despite its inability to rival mechanical energy as a machinery power source and appearing nearly redundant in the realm of magical engineering, he sensed that there might be overlooked possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mechanical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Good old cogs and bolts, the force propelling the world forward. Since constructing an automated peeler to assist his mother during his early days, Leopold had devoted his life to crafting increasingly remarkable automatons. Yet, even with a lifetime of accumulated knowledge and expertise, an external perspective might unveil something valuable."
  BAR_friend_magical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "In the realm of griffon researchers, scientists and inventors, Leopold stood as a paragon of arcane knowledge, with only a few who could rival him. His inventions were unmatched. However, throughout history, there were instances when somegriff entirely unfamiliar with the subject stumbled upon what others considered impossible. This might be one such case."
  BAR_friend_renowned_genius_desc:0 "Leopold found it unsurprising that many sought to collaborate with him or learn from his expertise. However, what truly astonished him was the wealth of knowledge he acquired through these collaborations. It offered a new perspective on the vastness of what he had yet to learn."
  BAR_friend_high_automation_desc:0 "Due to influx of new ideas and guidance of Asinti and Leopold new levels of automation was achieved in Barrad both in industry and agriculture."
  BAR_friend_sharing_knowledge_of_arcane_desc:0 "With the newfound approach of not hoarding knowledge like a precious treasure, the realm witnessed ideas and discoveries blossoming like flowers in the spring."
  BAR_friend_invite_other_to_study_magic_desc:0 "Once a secluded nation, safeguarding our magical secrets from the external world. Yet, now a deep feeling urges us to unveil the secrets of magic that we've unraveled throughout the passing years. Perhaps, in turn, the outside world may reciprocate this gesture of goodwill?"
  BAR_friend_everything_will_be_fine_desc:0 "The long journey weighed heavily on everyone in Barrad, particularly on the five pentarchs. However, one among them harbors deep concerns about the uncertainties the future might unfold. Are these apprehensions justified?"
  BAR_friend_agriculture_mechanization_desc:0 "Amidst intense negotiations and myriad conversations, Asinti successfully persuaded Leopold to embark on the ambitious undertaking he envisioned. The aspiration? To propel the Barradian countryside into a contemporary era where the toil of muscles becomes obsolete. A vision where common folk not only sustain themselves from the land but also contribute to the welfare of their entire communities."
  BAR_new_southern_friends_desc:0 "The fear among the creatures of Kasa was palpable, expecting conquest and enslavement, only to find our arrival upon their shores. We lack the necessary administrative infrastructure, the goodwill of the locals, and even a legitimate claim to these lands. Governing will prove to be a interesting challenge indeed."
  BAR_kasa_1_desc:0 "Numerous among our subjects have sought refuge in Kasa, drawn by its promises of sanctuary. Understandable, indeed. Yet, with our newfound commitment to change, this exodus could prove beneficial to our governance in those territories."
  BAR_kasa_2_desc:0 "As our coastline extends, the naval industry emerges as a pivotal component in safeguarding our security and asserting strategic dominance over maritime trade routes."
  BAR_kasa_3_desc:0 "Ambrosius advocates for a close intertwining of the economies of Barrad and Kasa, lest we spawn a parallel economic structure. There might be merit in it."
  BAR_kasa_4_desc:0 "Kasa has never had a robust network of land connections to Barrad, a fact that seemed inconsequential during our isolation. However, the time has come to alter this circumstance."
  BAR_kasa_5_desc:0 "The Kasans are a proud creatures, unyielding in their freedom. Surprisingly, we have no intention of challenging this aspect of their nature. Granting them a measure of autonomy seems only reasonable, the least we can offer."
  BAR_kasa_6_desc:0 "The passage of time has seen our southern border extend to the sea. For the Kasans, we have proven not to be the monsters they once feared, nor mere invaders seeking plunder. Perhaps the merging of our two realms is now within reach."
  BAR_our_deer_friends_desc:0 "The eastern deers have long been a source of trouble, their presence a thorn in the side of peace and stability. Perhaps it is in the best interest of all, ourselves included, that they now fall under our dominion?"
  BAR_olv_1_desc:0 "In a surge of inspiration, Silver Star suggested a course rarely taken with our neighbor: dialogue. Could there be reasonable minds among the deers, waiting to be heard and understood?"
  BAR_olv_2_desc:0 "It is had to distinguish what once stood there, and destruction wrought by our invasion. Regardless, it falls upon us to offer both resources and direction in the reconstruction efforts."
  BAR_olv_3_desc:0 "As befits a nation forged in the crucible of conflict, the craft of weaponry holds sway over both  society and economy. With strategic vision and ample resources, the arms industry may flourish, while casting us in a favorable light."
  BAR_olv_4_desc:0 "Never before have we found reason to link our realms, save for the occasional exchange of local goods across the river. Today, however, marks a shift in this paradigm."
  BAR_olv_5_desc:0 "In the absence of a reliable local administrative framework, our efforts to govern these lands demand heightened attention. We must exert ourselves doubly to ensure that the deers heed our counsel and guidance."
  BAR_olv_6_desc:0 ""Like it or not, we are here to stay" said Gąsienica when adressing grievances of the local lord."
  BAR_new_south_desc:0 "Amidst the vast disparities among the three southern realms, by magic or miracle we have succeeded in creating a semblance of governance. Remarkably, the inhabitants therein appear to coexist, if not with fervent affection, then at least with a glimmer of friendship."
  BAR_friend_miliatry_reform_desc:0 "From the moment he ascended to his position, Gąsienica persistently implored Ambrosius to form a substantial military force for the defense of both himself and the realm. However, intricate and sensitive political dynamics that led to Ambrosius' rise thwarted these pleas. Now, with the entire county in disarray, there is no rationale against establishing a formidable army."
  BAR_friend_desperate_employment_desc:0 "The core of our new military force lies what was once Ambrosius' personal army, yet we require additional soldiers to reinforce their ranks swiftly. Fortunately, a multitude of our subjects willingly steps forward to combat the deranged cultists who threaten to engulf their homes in flames."
  BAR_friend_employ_adventurers_desc:0 "Gąsienica harbors contempt for those self-proclaimed adventurers traversing the realm stirring up strife. However, with the allure of gold and glory, they can be swayed to lend their services as mercenaries."
  BAR_friend_scavenger_army_desc:0 "In our dearth of essential equipment, our primary focus must shift to the retrieval of weaponry from our vanquished adversaries."
  BAR_friend_wake_up_sleeping_knights_desc:0 "In his younger days Gąsienica heard legends of griffon knights sleeping in the mountains, awaiting to be called in the hour of need. One can only wonder if the legends are true, but the hour of need surely had come."
  BAR_friend_convince_dragons_desc:0 "Nestled within our mountains lie dormant dragons, guarding their treasures in the deepest of caverns. Ordinarily, rousing these majestic creatures would be a perilous endeavor, requiring the expertise of formidable mages. However, Gąsienica holds firm in his conviction that the second most potent force in the world, gold, can manage this situation and get us some allies."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The arms borne by our soldiers could easily find a place within the annals of a museum. It becomes imperative to embark on the development of modern weapon systems."
  BAR_friend_engineers_recon_desc:0 "Barrad terrain demands precision in troop movement, requiring an in-depth understanding of the obstacles and challenges that lie ahead."
  BAR_friend_engineer_corps_desc:0 "Given our modest forces, the strategic integration of field fortifications becomes imperative to level the playing field."
  BAR_friend_logistic_desc:0 "Count Ambrosius' forces sustained themselves through the land, a method effective when they functioned as mere thugs. However, for a modern army, this approach proves insufficient."
  BAR_friend_radio_desc:0 "Barrad hosts swift messengers, with Gąsienica being a prime example. However, the crucial skill of coordinating military operations across vast areas is one we cannot overlook. The future belongs to the radio."
  BAR_friend_anti_air_desc:0 "Competing in air warfare against nations with superior production capabilities poses a formidable challenge. Our strategy should pivot towards negating the aerial advantage of our adversaries through the deployment of anti-air equipment."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "Gąsienica firmly belives in the crucial role of regular soldiers during the battle, and to maximize their utility they need as powerfull weapons as we can provide them."
  BAR_friend_anti_tank_desc:0 "To adequately bolster our troops, we must furnish them with the capability to engage heavily armored adversaries."
  BAR_friend_artillery_desc:0 "Our current deficiency lies in the absence of suitable artillery to reinforce the advancement of our soldiers. We must prioritize the development of this arm or risk finding ourselves incapable of breaking through enemy lines."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_desc:0 "We must mobilize additional production capabilities to ensure a continuous supply of new equipment for our troops."
  BAR_friend_artillery_2_desc:0 "Not so long ago consulting Ambrosius, Leopold, or Viira regarding anything related to weaponry would undoubtedly yield the sentiment that bigger equates to better. There could be some merit in that."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_2_desc:0 "Currently our industrial capacity adequately provides the weaponry we require. However, there is a pressing need to consider expanding our existing factories to enhance our resilience in the event of disruptions to the supply lines."
  BAR_friend_light_tanks_desc:0 "Possessing armored units undoubtedly bestows a strategic advantage, but their utility in mountainous terrain remains limited. Nevertheless, there is merit in exploring the possibility of developing lighter variants capable of navigating challenging landscapes."
  BAR_friend_rocket_experiments_desc:0 "Leopold has developed interesting plans for a novel form of projectile propulsion. Although its strategic applications within our armed forces are still limited, delving into this field could unveil untapped possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_3_desc:0 "As our weapons become increasingly sophisticated, our factories must expand to accommodate the rising production costs."
  BAR_friend_medium_tanks_desc:0 "After a series of tests with light armored vehicles, it became evident that they cannot fulfill the role we envisioned for them. A new tank design must be created, featuring enhanced firepower and armor, yet remaining light enough to navigate challenging terrain."
  BAR_friend_independent_military_units_desc:0 "Empowering smaller units with significant autonomy in their operations provides them with heightened flexibility and better adaptability to fulfill their assigned missions. This approach also alleviates the burden on higher command, allowing Gąsienica to oversee more things simultaneously."
  BAR_friend_mountaineers_desc:0 "While most of our soldiers know very well hot to live and fight in mountains and hills of Barrad we still can select individuals that do it best and form specialized divisions."
  BAR_friend_mountain_expertise_desc:0 "Born amidst these towering peaks, destined to draw our final breaths amidst their rugged embrace. We are the but a humble children of these mountains, none know their terrain as we do, none are as adept in the art of warfare amid their craggy expanse."
  BAR_friend_conscription_system_desc:0 "For too long, Barrad has relied upon hastily raised levies, hired swords, or scant bands of seasoned warriors. It is time we forge a more dependable foundation. A system of conscription must be erected, binding our people to the defense of their homeland."
  BAR_friend_harmonic_conscription_system_desc:0 "Change sweeps over us like a gap wind, reshaping the very rock beneath our paws and hooves. No longer must we compel our people into the ranks of our army. Instead, they flock to our banners willingly, their fervor burning bright as the star."
  BAR_friend_mil_factories_desc:0 "In these turbulent times, the demands upon our army for equipment are ceaseless. We must possess the capacity to meet these demands without fail."
  BAR_friend_equipment_simplification_desc:0 "In the annals of Barrad's history, prosperity has been but a distant dream. Yet, from the crucible of hardship, our creatures have honed a skill indispensable in the craft of weaponry -  the art of resourcefulness."
  BAR_friend_air_warfare_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, winged beings understood the significance of commanding the aerial domain in the theater of war. And as ages changes, so too must our methods evolve to secure this crucial advantage."
  BAR_friend_light_planes_desc:0 "Much akin to the griffon soaring aloft, the machine designed to dominate the sky must possess swiftness and agility as its foremost attributes."
  BAR_friend_tac_bomber_desc:0 "To hold dominance over the sky is but a part of the equation, the capacity to project power from it is a different matter that warrants our attention."
  BAR_friend_air_accidents_prevention_desc:0 "The skies above Barrad are fraught with perilous magical anomalies. It behooves us to provide our pilots with the necessary training to navigate such treacherous enviroment."
  BAR_friend_plane_factories_desc:0 "To secure aerial supremacy over the battlefield, we must establish specialized factories solely dedicated to the production of new aircraft."

  barrad_friends.997.d:0 "As Silver Star, Viira, Leopold, and Asinti embraced the spirit of Harmony, they decided to overthrow Count Ambrosius and his cruel minions. The mad Count refused to abdicate, and battle was joined. Ambrosius and his minions were no match for the combined power of the four friends, however, and they were quickly defeated. As the four became close friends, they fully realized the depths of their wrongdoing. They appeared before the commoners of Barrad and apologized for their actions, admitting that their aims were misguided.\n\nThe peasants, however, did not care. When they realized the four had let their guard down and were within reach, they immediately descended upon them to enact their vengeance for decades of horror, abuse and slavery. An angry mob of hundreds of ponies armed with pitchforks and torches swarmed the magocrats and slew them one by one before they even realized what was happening. Thus, the Pentarchy came to a violent and sudden end.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events is sure to signal the beginning of a new era for Barrad, although only time will tell if it is to be a happy one."

Profoundly unsettled, trying to converse with Viira was akin to chatting with a ravenous wolf behind its toothy grin.\n\nHowever, this sensation had recently changed. Before, Silver would've searched a way out of a situation involving Viira. He now found himself oddly at peace as the two of them shared the main table at the library, each diving deep into their tomes. The unicorn hadn't even noticed Viira, and when he did, there was no reflexive recoil nor a shudder. Instead, as Viira looked up to meet his eyes, she smiled and greeted him with a "you're looking well."\n\nPerhaps, had Silver been anypony else, Viira might have seen him as a threat that required eliminating. Together, however, she merely treated him as a partner, an ally... a friend?\n\nSilver, with a faint smile, greeted back."
  barrad_friends.1.a:0 "You too, Viira."
  barrad_friends.2.t:0 "Mechanical Aid"
  barrad_friends.2.d:0 ""So, what have you been up to, Silver?"\n\nSilver nursed his glass of red wine with some hesitation. He kept eyeing Leopold's study for some hidden trap or weapon stash that the griffon would reach for were he to take a disliking to Silver suddenly.\n\nHe swallowed his hesitation. "What else? Worrying over the frailty of mortality."\n\nLeopold's mechanical eye whirred as he sipped his drink, making Silver tense up slightly. "Do you fear me?" Leopold asked unexpectedly.\n\n"I- yes," Silver replied with a start, somewhat surprised at his own candidness.\n\n"And why is that?" Leopold placed his glass on the table beside him. "I've never once made an attempt on your life, have I?" At Silver's silence, the griffon added, "I've only spoken about bettering people. I've mostly referred to enhancements in strength and durability, true, but in essence, I want people to live better. And how do people who enjoy better lives fare?"\n\nSilver looked up. "They... they live longer," he answered, slowly understanding.\n\n"Exactly, Silver," Leopold said with a cackle. "Were we to work together, why, you could live forever. Wouldn't you fancy that?"\n\nSilver suddenly became very interested in what Leopold had to say."
  barrad_friends.2.a:0 "I would... I would so very much!"
  barrad_friends.3.t:0 "Skulls"
  barrad_friends.3.d:0 "Silver eyed the bleached form of what he presumed were zebra skulls. They looked startlingly like that of a pony, and it unnerved him how Asinti seemed to speak unheard words to them. Silver wasn't even sure why he'd come to Asinti's own abode—the mad stallion was talking to skulls!\n\nAsinti's cold eyes shifted. "What brings you here, Silver Star of Wittenland?" He spoke quietly yet with authority.\n\n"Did- did you know them?" Silver asked, trying not to imagine the corpses that the skulls once were.\n\nThe zebra rose to all four, a grimace forming on his face. "Not all of them," he admitted, "but they all deserve respect regardless."\n\nSilver had to fight against baulking at the idea of giving praise to skeletons—to death itself, but his reaction was still evident. "I know of your fears, young one." The elder zebra slowly approached the Wittenlander, and placed a hoof upon his shoulder. "I only wish to stop the institution that causes the needless pain and suffering that always ends in the deaths of innocents."\n\nThe unicorn turned to face the grinning skulls. Had he been born a zebra, how likely would it have been that his skull was part of Asinti's collection? Facing Asinti, Silver asked, "To stop their deaths and those of others?"\n\n"Wherever I am capable of doing so," he stated firmly, his grimace fading. "Why won't you help me to stop the deaths of those in suffering?"\n\nSilver mulled over his words. Perhaps he would never get over the absurdity of the skull collection. Still, he could put his unease aside to save others besides himself."

  barrad_friends.4.d:0 "    Silver Star burst from his room so quickly that his undead servants didn't even have a chance to see him leave. It was a panic and concern so profound that it propelled him through the dim corridors of his tower, until the cool night air hit him as he emerged outside.\n    Usually, his nightmares would lure his instinct into hiding away in the deepest recesses of his tower, to surround himself with the familiar and the controllable. Yet, here he was, standing defiantly outside in the dead of night, driven by a force stronger than fear. The chill of the night enveloped him, not just as a physical sensation but as a harbinger of the dark future with single question swirling in his mind"

  barrad_friends.5.t:0 "A Most Unpleasant Surprise"
  barrad_friends.5.d:0 "    Gąsienica cautiously entered a room in the basement of the manor. "My lord," he greeted, finding Ambrosius in the midst of one of his experiments, holding a vial that looked to be filled with blood.\n    Ambrosius turned around, slightly startled. Recognizing Gąsienica, he casually tossed the vial aside and asked, "Yes? What brings you here?"\n    "It's about Asinti, Viira, Leopold, and Silver Star," Gąsienica started, getting straight to the point.\n    "Have they done something amusing?" Ambrosius asked with clear excitation in his voice.\n    "No, my lord. They have, in fact, formed an alliance and ceased their conflicts," Gąsienica reported.\n    Upon hearing it Ambrosius bursted into laughter. It echoed off the stone walls, growing in intensity until it felt like it was repleacing the air in the room. And as the sound of laughter were consuming the room, shadows on the walls began stretching and expanding until they threatened to engulf everything in darkness.\n    Gąsienica acted swiftly. He reached for his master, pulling him close with one claw while retrieving a small vial of liquid from around his neck. Without hesitation he uncorked the vial and poured its contents into Ambrosius's open mouth. Upon drinking it, his body and spirit began to calm down, and so too did the shadows retreating to their corners.\n    Once Ambrosius was steady on his hooves again, Gąsienica asked, "Should I deal with them, my lord?""
  barrad_friends.5.a:0 "Yes, do it"

  barrad_friends.6.t:0 "Shadows in the Night"
  barrad_friends.6.d:0 "    The sun was setting, creating a rare backdrop for Silver Star who usually did not get outside at this hour. However, an invite from Leopold for a card games night was enough for him to change his usual habits. Although he had always been skeptical about card games until he discovered you can play them with others. He was so distracted by strategizing about the night ahead, he nearly missed out the subtle movement in the bushes beside the road.\n    At near instant alert he turned towards the noise, ready for whatever might emerge. His readiness paid off when a hooded figure with a knife jumped out of the bushes. Silver Star had imagined this exact situation too many times and reacted quickly, sidestepping the initial attack. As the attacker spun for a second strike, aiming for Silver Star's throat, the knife met not flesh but a magical barrier.\n    "Face your end, vile beast!" Silver Star shouted, convinced about his victory.\n    However, the assassin didn't waste time with barter. When their knife got stuck in the barrier, they pulled out a strange device that began draining the magic from Silver Star's shield. Caught off guard, Silver Star felt a rush of panic. Without time to think of a new plan, he channeled all his magic into a powerful beam that fired it at the attacker, hitting them in the head.\n    After ensuring there were no more attackers hiding nearby, Silver Star took a moment to catch his breath and approached the fallen assassin. Removing the hood revealed a zebra, which left Silver Star's confused. The cloak, adorned with odd symbols that matched those found in the cave the explored and on the garments of cultists Viira had taken an interest in, raised further questions."

  barrad_friends.7.d:0 "Silver Star had always been good at spotting trouble, but this situation was throwing him off. Usually, identifying threats was straightforward for him, like spotting a clear stream in the daylight. Now, doubting the people he had grown close to felt uncomfortable and confusing. He thought inviting everyone to his tower might shed some light on this case — if someone had ill intentions, perhaps they'd skip the meeting. But they all showed up, leaving Silver Star still clueless. He hadn't mentioned what had happened that night, still trying to figure out the best way to bring it up.\n    "Silver, are you with us?" Leopold interrupted his thoughts. "You seem troubled."\n    Caught off guard Silver Star needed an excuse. "I... I'm just sad I missed our game night," he said.\n    "What game night?" Viira looked puzzled. "Are you sure you're not mixing it up with a dream?"\n    That question sent Silver Star's mind racing. He quickly thought it might be Leopold, or it was just a coverup to trick him. "Maybe that's it. I've been having trouble sleeping," he deflected.\n    "If you're having trouble sleeping, I have a great tonic for that," Asinti offered, sounding genuinely helpful.\n    Silver Star's suspicion momentarily jumped to Asinti. Would that tonic put him eternal slumber? But then he remembered that strange device, it didn't seem like alchemy.\n    "No, it won't make you sleep forever," said old zebra.\n    A telepath! Silver Star's mind shouted, But his inner monologue was interrupted once more by Asinti, "Sadly, I can't read others' thoughts."\n    "How did you know..." Silver Star began to ask.\n    "You tend to mumble when you're lost in thought," Viira pointed out with a smile.\n    "No, I don't," Silver Star denied, genuinely surprised.\n    "Yes, you do. No one just had the heart to tell you," Leopold added.\n    Viira laughed softly, finding the entire situation amusing. "I always thought it was kind of cute."\n    Silver Star stood there, completely bewildered, not sure how to process what was happening around him.\n    "Look, my friend," Leopold tried to reassure him, but Asinti cut in with a dose of practical wisdom.\n    "Think about it. If one of us, or even better, all of us wanted to kill you, we would have done it a long time ago," the old zebra said."

  barrad_friends.11.d:0 "    The expedition made its way deep underground, navigating darkness veiling the ancient tunnels. As they delved deeper and deeper, it seemed like walls and floor they were walking on started to whisper secrets from past ages. However this relative calm soon turned into an ambush. Cultists attacked with ferocity and swiftness beyond that of mere mortal. Their moves unpredictable, appearing to be driven by power beyond comprehension. The black robes they wore fluttered around them, resembling the wings of some dark, otherworldly creatures.\n    The battle's intensity grew as the cultists, fueled by their fanatic devotion, seemed unstoppable. With eerie chants on their lips, calling upon their dark deity, drawing strength from their faith. Gąsienica and the four friends managed to break away from the ambush and press forward, leaving their soldiers behind. Soon they entered the cult's central chamber, a grand cathedral where they were met with an ominous silence. At the heart of the sanctum stood a massive gate, darker than the night sky itself. There,  Ambrosius lying unconscious on the altar. Seeing his master Gąsienica flew to assist him, but was stopped by a sudden gunshot. Turning around, he saw Leopold with a smoking gun.\n    "Sorry, big one, neither you nor he are getting out of here alive," Leopold declared.\n    Gąsienica examining his new wound said without turning to face them, "We will see"."

  barrad_friends.12.d:0 "Leopold aimed at the massive griffon. However before he could pull the trigger he found himself knocked down on the ground. In the blink of an eye, Gąsienica managed to close the gap between them and now stood above the sickly griffon, preparing to finish him off. Lying there, Leopold struggled to catch his breath and unable to reach his gun. But suddenly a thick cloud of smoke enveloped both griffons.\n    Viira, seizing the moment quickly dragged Leopold behind a large stone bench for cover. When Leopold tried to speak, she shushed him. "Hold your breath. I'll try to get Asinti here to help you," she whispered urgently, peeking over the bench. Through the clearing smoke, she saw Asinti and Gąsienica in a standoff, each waiting for the other to make the next move.\n    Driven more by instinct than by a well-thought-out strategy, Viira picked up a stone tablet from the bench and hurled it at Gąsienica, hoping to distract or, better yet, injure him. To her astonishment, he caught it mid-air and sent it flying towards Asinti with much greater speed. The tablet struck the old zebra in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.\n    As Viira tried to understand what had just happened, Gąsienica's gaze fixed on her. Seeing it she knew she had to run, though outrunning the griffon was unlikely. Preparing to flee, her mind filled with fear and desperation, she cried for a miracle to save her."

As Gąsienica attacked Leopold, he was paralyzed by fear, unable to act, and instinctively sought refuge in the darkness. His whole body was frozen by the shock of the attack.\n    Lost in his fear, Silver Star hid, losing track of time in his panic. Seconds felt like hours as he tried to make sense of his thoughts, but the terror of his situation made it impossible to think clearly.\n    Then, a sharp scream snapped him out of his daze. It was Viira, trying to escape wrath of Gąsienica. Yet, what recourse did Silver Star possess, other than to flee as he had done countless times before?

She approached him slowly, subtly wiggling her eyebrows.\n    She reached out and grabbed his robe. "'It's something I should have done a long time ago," said Viira, coming face to face with him. Time seemed to slow, and sweat dripped down Silver Star's muzzle. "Goodbye." His eyes went wide, but before he had time to process what had happened, the deed was already done. Viira subtly kissed his forehead while still holding a dagger behind her back. "Be careful," she added."

Confused, she saw Silver Star standing before Gąsienica, trying to maintain a magical barrier between them. Fearing that any sound might break his concentration, she ran away to check on Asinti and Leopold.\n    "Are you both okay?" Viira asked as she approached, her voice full of concern.\n    Leopold, despite his injuries responded, "I've had worse." He held up a vial for Asinti. "This one?"\n    Asinti, weakly, corrected him, "Indigo, not purple."\n    Leopold finding the right potion, administered it to Asinti. "I hope this elixir has some effect," he murmured before collapsing to the ground, his eyes clouded by a haze of pain.\n    "Silver Star is fighting Gąsienica. We need to help him," Viira urged.\n    With every movement causing him pain, Leopold began to unbutton his suit. "I have a hypothesis," he said while revealing arcane machinery infused into part of his body. He began to detach part of it. "Get to him point-blank and connect these two cables," he explained while giving a magical crystal to Viira. "Don't lose it, I will die without it," he added with a heavy sigh.\n    "No! You can't risk your life like that," Viira protested.\n    "Just go and save that unicorn," he said, barely audible."

But each blow from the colossal griffon threatened to shatter the unicorn's defense, his hope of striking back fading like a dying ember.\n    In the midst of this chaos Viira emerged from the shadows seizing upon an opportune moment and rushed towards the griffon. Unseen by him, as he was focused on attacking the unicorn, she prepared a mysterious device Leopold gave her. Viira yelled for Silver Star to take cover, then activated the device causing a massive magical impulse that shook the room and incapacitated Gąsienica.\n    Viira quickly rushed to ensure Silver Star is alright, relieved to find him safe. Leopold and Asinti also appeared, supporting each other in standing straight. Seeing Gąsienica defeated, Leopold was started to look for the gun to finish him off.\n    Yet, as Silver Star looked at the defeated griffon crawling toward his unconscious master, a flicker of recognition danced within his mind. He heard the faint echoes of a familiar scene, the day he survived the savage Cossack raid as a mere foal. A loyal servant, who shielded him with his own body against the blades. For two harrowing days, Silver Star had lain beneath the lifeless form of his devoted servant, bearing witness to that very same look he saw in Gąsienica's eyes right now.\n    "Leave them," Silver Star commanded. Hearing Leopold's objections, Silver Star added "Let's be above this"."

And as she was about to touch the black surface of the giant gate Silver Star's voice brought her back to reality.\n    "If you want to explore it we can come back later," said Silver Star.

When he was young, he'd read forbidden passages of powerful mages in the far north who had mastered the art of unlife. Still, those scraps of knowledge seemed to overlook something crucial: the amount a pony would have to sacrifice in order to gain immortality.\n\nSilver Star looked at his foreleg. Once vibrant in color and with neatly combed fur, it was now a shriveled, pale tan that lost patches of fur every time he brushed his hoof across it. It was... disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nHe tried to take solace in his victory over the Pentarchy, though the joy and vindication he had first felt seemed more elusive than ever. Emptiness seemed to be his primary emotion now, despite his best attempts to deny it.\n\nThe Archlich paused as he tried to focus on that phantom feeling. Perhaps... perhaps if he replicated it. If he became more powerful, if he defeated greater foes, then this emptiness might go away."

Still nothing, he realized, as he tossed aside the now-inert skeleton.\n\nThis was becoming a serious problem. Silver looked down at his foreleg again. Some parts of the bone were starting to show through the various tissues and ligaments, and if he looked closely enough, he could see the magic aura that allowed his body to move in undeath. He briefly wondered if becoming a lich might have been a mistake.\n\nSilver shook his head to rid himself of that notion. No, there was no mistake. He simply hasn't found what would make him truly happy, yet. He simply needed to keep looking, to keep trying...\n\nHis thoughts turned to the Kingdom of Wittenland from which he had been ostracized.

Ambrosius was in awe of the majestic device, and ephemeral voices beckoned him to approach it, come closer... He did, shambling towards it until suddenly the voices stopped and the pain started.\n\nIt was as if an entire universe was trying to make its home inside his skull! Unable to withstand it, he keeled over, screaming in pain. He brought his hooves to his head in an attempt to keep it from bursting from all he felt inside it. Upon seeing Ambrosius' state, Gąsienica was frantic, and poured many doses of the Count's medicine into his open mouth. Was this much of the drug unsafe? Gąsienica didn't know, but he had to do something.\n\nWithin the mind of Ambrosius, he fought against the invading presence with all his will. His thoughts were chaotic and it was impossible to centre himself. All seemed to be a whirlwind of hatred and hostility, until he noticed a voice inside the cacophony that was different from the rest. He sensed this part of the presence did not wish him harm, and so he focused on it. It told him what the presence truly was, that it was the product of seven ancient unicorns who had used a primordial spell from another age to merge together into one consciousness, but now was totally dependent on magic in order to survive. It told him that they did not want to cause all this, but that Ambrosius had unleashed a power that had corrupted them. Finally, it told him that it would use the last of its uncorrupted will to free him from his madness.\n\nAmbrosius awoke to find Gąsienica beside him, grateful to see him alive. For the first time in an eternity, the fog was gone. His thoughts were finally clear. He felt like vomiting, but there wasn't time. He was responsible for an immense mistake, and there was no time to waste in putting things right. "Return to the surface, Gąsienica," said Ambrosius. "I must stay here and work on a way to fix what I have broken. Make sure things don't fall apart out there in the meantime.""

After emerging from a narrow pass, he smiled as he laid eyes on his home village at peace. The aftermath of their battle with the plants was still visible, but now the mangled monstrosities were overgrown by vegetation of a more mundane variety.\n\nAs soon as he entered the town Jánošík came out to greet him, laughing heartily. "Good to see you, friend! Come to drag us out of the fire again?" He gave Gąsienica a playful punch which had absolutely no effect.\n\n"Not this time, fortunately," said Gąsienica. "In fact, I have come to ask you for assistance. The Count is... away dealing with a matter of some importance. As you are a more respected figure than I among the mountain villages, your support would be appreciated at this time." Jánošík wore a mask of inscrutable contemplation. "Since he protected you in your time of need, it's only fair that you help him in return."\n\n"No, no." Jánošík wagged a claw. "It wasn't him that saved us, it was you. And so I will do this for you." His voice shifted to become deadly serious. "Under one condition - if we are to respect your rule, you should respect ours. Promise that our villages will retain their autonomy, and I will help." Gąsienica nodded, and the two shook claws."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.3.d:0 "Gąsienica walked cautiously down dark forest paths in search of the mysterious merchant Jánošík had dealt with in the past. It was this dealer that had provided them the artifact to ward off the corrupted plants when no other means proved effective, and any creature trading in such powerful magic was worth seeking out. Gąsienica had gone to the last place Jánošík said he met with the merchant, but saw only abandoned buildings with no civilisation in sight.\n\nHe was on the verge of giving up hope when a raspy voice slithered out from the darkness. "A visitor?" Gąsienica turned around and was surprised to find a stallion dressed in discoloured rags beckoning to him. As Gąsienica approached, the stallion gave a wide smile, revealing a glimmering gold tooth. "Come in!" He disappeared into a decrepit shack with Gąsienica following behind.\n\n"You have come a long way looking for something, haven't you?" The stallion looked over the strange items that covered the walls before rummaging through one of the many containers laying haphazardly around the shack. "How about this?" He asked, pulling out an item and tossing it to Gąsienica. "This artifact will ensure you gain the favour of the people," he explained. Gąsienica ran his claws over the teardrop shaped object and could feel the magical power within. "Use it during the wet season to increase crop yields by an enormous amount."\n\nGąsienica had found his merchant, but this was quite unexpected. "You're just... giving it to me?" he asked.\n\n"You have earned it." The merchant raised his hooves high in praise. "You have done more good for this land than you know, my griffon friend!""

They sensed an opportunity, and were simply waiting for the right time to make their move. It was clear that they were far from convinced, words alone would not be enough."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.5.d:0 "Gąsienica traveled to contact a shadowy cult that operated at the fringes of Barradian society. Although a bit obscure, they had several wealthy patrons and wielded a lot of influence, so gaining their support could prove very useful. When he reached their secluded compound, he found a scene of chaos and heated arguments. No two cultists had kind things to say to one another, and the volatile atmosphere felt like it could combust into violence at any moment.\n\nIt seemed that the Pentarchy's actions had ultimately created a schism within the cult. None of the members had heard from their god in some time, and they felt the deity's influence was growing weaker by the day. Those in the cult's Inner Circle accused the Outer Circle of being faithless, while those in the Outer Circle accused the Inner Circle of becoming corrupt and rotten, prompting their god to abandon them.\n\nGąsienica sighed.

When Gąsienica reached him, Ambrosius looked tired, having studied magical texts nearly nonstop preparing the ritual to heal the being that had driven him to madness and back. Gąsienica held his breath as Ambrosius approached the reactor to perform the ritual. When he began the ritual in earnest, power started swirling all around them until suddenly, everything stopped, and the world became still.\n\nA voice spoke to both of them, but it was not the elusive, shifting voice Ambrosius was used to hearing. It was a calm voice, low and quiet but at the same time not difficult to hear. "I am awake." The presence in the air washed over them like an ocean current. "My actions have wrought so much pain, so much destruction. For that, I can not express the magnitude of my sorrow." The room seemed to somehow fill with sadness. "But now I am freed from hunger and chaos, and I wish to do now what I have been unable to do for far too long. Let us make this world a better place."\n\nGąsienica was in shock from what he was witnessing and was completely unsure how to react. Ambrosius, however, smiled. "Yes, let's.""

With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workponies and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.

He let them linger, but when silence returned as sole reply, he pressed on. "So, maybe we should start over again how the situation looks like so it might be easier to find a solution to it."\n    The room remained quiet, except for Asinti's heavy sigh. He had heard this more times than he cared to count, each repetition seemingly more fruitless than the last. Expecting the griffon to speak up any moment, he swept over the room. His gaze paused on Viira, she seemed disconnected from the what is happening around, her stare piercing through the mortal veil into some distant abyss. It was a look he knew too well—the haunting sight of someone who had faced death. His attention then shifted to Silver Star. Despite the recent chaos, the unicorn appeared outwardly calm, but Asinti could sense an inner turmoil. Whatever Silver Star was wrestling with remained a mystery for him now.\n    Leopold, not deterred by their silence, began, "Given our recent actions, we're now facing..."\n    "We get it," Asinti cut in before Leopold could outline their bleak situation again. "Ambrosius is in a coma, cultists are on the warpath, chaos reigns, and everypony is vying for power. While Gąsienica is trying to reestablish some order with the fire and sword." He locked eyes with Leopold. "Did I miss anything?"\n    "That sums it up," Leopold conceded. "Which is why I believe we should ignite the reactor. It might just give us the advantage we need." He turned to Viira, "What do you think, my deer?"\n    "I... I don't really know," Viira's response was barely audible.\n    Leopold, persistent, tried to rally support from her, his questions becoming increasingly insistent as he sought to persuade her. As Asinti began to argue with him, their voices merged into a meaningless cacophony for Viira. The world around her dimmed, memories flashing in the encroaching darkness. The rapid beating of her heart was the last tether to reality before her mind spiraled into the void. And in that moment of near dissolution, a simple feeling of warmth snapped her out of it. Opening her eyes, she found Silver Star trying to hug her.\n    "Leopold is right, we should ignite it," Silver Star suddenly declared, his confidence surprising for the rest. "But there are only four of us, which is why we need Gąsienica to return the favor. Hopefully, this settles the debate," he added. Rest of the group only looked at eachother and responded:"

Viira, feeling the tension, instinctively moved slightly behind Silver Star.\n    Seeing Viira's subtle move, Silver Star went ahead with what they had come to say. "We think we've got a way to wake up Ambrosius," he said, keeping his eyes on Gąsienica for any reaction.\n    At the mention of his lord Gąsienica flinched, most would not notice but Silver Star was very keen on seeing any kind of movement.\n    "The reactor, it has great magic potential. We believe we can use that power to heal Ambrosius," unicorn explained.\n    "What do you need me to do?" Gąsienica asked.\n    "We need some time to make this work, and we need somepo... somegriff to keep the cultists off our backs," Silver Star laid out.\n"I'll do my best," Gąsienica agreed, committing to his part in their plan.

Nonetheless, he replied, "Good to meet you too."\n    "Not big on talking, are you?" Janosik observed. "Are you here alone?"\n    Silver Star just nodded, slowly realizing he is going to be surrounded by the griffons and one of them nearly killed him.\n    "Don't worry, you'll be fine at the party with me. I'll make sure you don't drink too much," Janosik assured him.\n    "Party?" Silver Star was now clearly confused.\n    "Didn't Gąsienica tell you? You think we will make arrangement with someone we haven't drink with?," Janosik said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n    The giant griffon's piercing gaze became even more intense, as if that was possible.

Suddenly, the priestess felt movement behind her. Before she could react, someone grabbed her mane, and in one swift motion, she was thrown to the floor.\n    The sound of body slamming into the floor drew three more creatures into the room, who quickly turned on the lights."Asinti, what is going on?"

It felt like the crystal itself was calling her by the name.\n    "Viira!" Asinti's voice snapped her back to reality. "Are you alright? I'm quite worried about you."\n    "No, no. I'm fine," she replied hastily, "Do you need my help with anything?"\n    "Quite the contrary," the old zebra looked at her.

The question lingered for a while.\n    "I have," he admitted, but it was clear the answer did not same to him easily. Old zebra's expression changed like an arrow pierced his hearth.\n    "And how did it make you feel afterward?" Viira pressed on.\n    "Horrible," he confessed after a long moment of silence.

Without looking away from the task at his claw, he asked, "And how are you holding up Viira?"\n    The deer, nestled in a corner of the room had been sitting awfuly quiet. The revelations she had shared with her friends about the cult, the reactor, and her initial intentions had left her in a whirlpool of emotions. She wrestled with feelings of shame, regret, anger at the missed opportunity. Yet amidst it all, she found... a relief. Despite deception and lying being her second nature, sharing the truth with her friend felt suprisingly great. The support and understanding they offered in response to her confession had been unexpected but immensely comforting. They came up with a new plan, use the reactor's power to obliterate the ancient entity, aiming to liberate Barrad from its curse once and for all.\n    "Quiet day, huh?" Leopold attempted to once again banter with Viira.\n    "I'm just worried," she admitted, her voice tinged with apprehension.\n    "A bit late for second thoughts," Asinti commented, turning towards her.

Then a melody caught his attention, a piano piece so tender it momentarily swept away his concerns. Curious to discover its source, he followed the sound, hoping to distract himself from his swirling thoughts. \n    "Beautiful song," Silver Star remarked, upon finding the creature behind the music.\n    Gąsienica caught off guard, ceased playing.

I've never heard anything like it."\n    "Only two beings knew it, and now only I do," Gąsienica answered, now with his usual tone.\n    "And the other was?" Silver Star pressed.\n    "A pony who taught me to play, and a dear friend," said Gąsienica, pausing before adding, " Better known as my former lord's wife."\n    As Silver Star approached the piano, he looked up at Gąsienica. "Don't think I ever met her," he admitted.\n    "She's long dead," Gąsienica said, staring into the distance. " She wanted me to kill Ambrosius, in response I was ordered to execute her."\n    The unicorn tried to say something, but could not find proper words. Seeing him struggle the griffon added, "Gladly under your rule I won't need to do it again."\n    "What makes you think so?" Silver Star was confused by the sudden shift.\n    Gąsienica met his gaze squarely. "Am I mistaken, my lord? Just give me an order."\n    "No, no, no!" Silver Star shouted. "I… I never sought such responsibility," he confessed more softly.\n    "But it is yours now," Gąsienica stated. "Such is life."\n    "Were you not supposed to cheer me up?" said the unicorn.\n    "You didn't order me to," Gąsienica retorted.\n    Caught by the absurdity of the moment, Silver Star let out a small, reluctant smile. "Then, as my first order, teach me that song.""

  barrad_friendship_tree.9.d:0 "    The task of flushing the cultists out of hiding and capturing them turned out to be unexpectedly straightforward, but we soon understood the underlying reason. The cultists were not genuinely engaging in battle; their actions were merely a diversion. Unbeknownst to us, they had orchestrated a much larger catastrophe. They managed to unleash the waters of underground lakes into the Elis River, causing a devastating flood which affected all nearby towns and villages.\n    However, amidst this hour of trial, when many ponies lives were lost and countless more lost off what they had, a miracle happened. Before the Pentarchy or Gąsienica could organize any formal relief efforts, the common ponies took the matter in their own hoofs. They came together, raising sandbags to curb the flooding, helping to evacuate, and providing shelter to those who had lost their homes. And while they did not had much they did what was in their power and much more."

As he spoke, a tear began to trace down his cheek, prompting Leopold to place a reassuring claw on the unicorn's arm.\n    "Then I trust you know what you're doing," said Leopold.\n    "For once, I think I do," Silver Star replied with a slight nod.

Or at least as much solitude as one could have in his position. Nestled deep in the Barradian countryside, only his most devoted followers dared to visit him—along with his new friends. In fact, these new relationships were precisely why Asinti found himself wrestling with his thoughts so intensely lately. Halting his life's work would be challenging for anyzebra, but for him it was particularly daunting. Not only had he sacrificed so much already, but failing to achieve his goals would mean that all his actions would be in vain.\n    "I told you, you shouldn't dwell on it," a too familiar voice interrupted his solitude. "How many times must I remind you to continue our work?" the disembodied voice persisted, urging him on. "Just think of all the good we could still achieve."\n    "And what about them?" Asinti asked aloud to the empty tent.\n    "If they stand in our way... the same as last time," the voice replied in a lower tone.

"And what are you going to do?" the laughter transformed back into the familiar voice. "Tell the spirit of your brother he died for nothing? Or…" the voice grew louder, more insistent. "Do you want to return to being a slave? Is that the fate you truly want for yourself and your fellow creatures, for Illi's foals?"\n    "Silence!" Asinti shouted at the empty room. "Don't speak her name."\n    "Struck a nerve?" the voice laughed mockingly.

There was something eerily familiar about this place but he could not point exactly what. It was reminiscent of the village they had once established in Kasa. Everything felt much simpler back then, and memories of those days stirred within him, prompting reflections on the choices he had made. What if he had taken different paths? How different might life have been?\n    "You would have ended up as just another nameless slave," a voice in his head answered.\n    Asinti determined not to engage with it, concentrated all his strength on recalling those distant memories. His effort paid off, and a serene image formed in his mind. Zebras constructing a new home, foals playing joyfully around them, and beside him… her, smiling as always. But in a blink, it all changed. The smiling face dissolved into tears, the tears turned to blood. Asinti's heart raced as he saw the zebras constructing a pyre and the foals now chanting dark spells. He knew  what would come next, but was abruptly pulled from his vision by a small, squeaky voice.\n    "I'm sorry, mister," a young filly pulled his robe, her eyes wide and fearful. "You're looking for ponies, can you help us?"\n    "What do you need, young one?" Asinti asked.\n    "I can't find my mommy and dad," the filly began to cry. "I haven't seen them since some ponies in black robes came."\n    Asinti knew all too well what the cultists did to those they took, and a dark thought crossed his mind, whispered by the persistent voice in his head. Innocent blood, so pure and precious… it holds a lot of power. He quickly shook the thought from his mind, ignoring the voice's objections.\n    "Mister…" the filly tugged at his robe again, her tears having dried. "…we can't find my friends' mommies either."\n    Old zebra looked down at the innocent face before him. It would be so easy, so quick, so satisfying... His body tingled with the temptation, one command and he could claim their souls for our cause. We both know there is only one right choice.\n    "Yes, I know," Asinti said aloud, making his decision. "Come, little one, gather your friends and I will help you look for your parents."\n    The foal's face lit up with a grateful smile. "Thank you, thank you, mister!" she exclaimed as she ran towards one of the houses to call her friends."

But the hoofsteps were very light and careful, there was only one creature in Elysium he knew who had that kind of delicate step.\n    "Why are you here?

Now, as he lay there, a barrage of memories, both bitter and sweet, washed over him, each one a reminder of the journey he'd been on.\n    His quiet contemplation was suddenly interrupted by the sound of Viira's voice.

"And how, pray tell, did you manage to find me here?" he asked, genuinely curious.\n    "Oh, a little bird told me. Well, not so little - in fact pretty big one." She replied with a grin on her face.\n    Chuckling, Silver Star shook his head and lay back down. Viira feeling the peacefulness of this place decided to join him. "So, have you thought about what's next?" she ventured as she lied next to him.\n    Silver Star turned his head to look at her and said "Trying living in the moment?".\n    Viira nudged him. "You? Living in the moment?" she teased, her eyes sparkling with laughter.\n    Silver Star pretended to sigh heavily. "Have I ever mentioned how incredibly annoying you are?" he quipped, though the way his eyes looked at the deer betrayed the unicorn's true feelings.\n    "Once or twice." Viira responded with a smile, leaning in closer. "But what do you say? Should we just camp out here, letting life pass us by?" Her tone was light, but below the surface lied genuine curiosity about their future.\n    Silver Star considered her words for a moment, then said, "Would that be such a bad thing? Especially with the right deer by your side. "\n    "I guess not," she admitted while laughing. "But don't you ever wonder about the different paths we could explore?"\n    Silver Star gave a thoughtful nod. "It's often said that we can shape our own future. Yet, could it be we've already accomplished our part?"\n    Viira didn't respond only giving him a smile, and then they stayed, lying next to each other, relishing the calm of the here and now.

"It might always seem like something is off with him, but this time it's different." As they approached the temple where Asinti had secluded himself, both Silver Star and Viira started to share his suspicions.

Did you open a community center or something?"\n    "You could say that," Asinti replied. This is so pathetic, you know that? The voice added, but he ignored it. "They had nowhere else to go... so I figured, why not here?"\n    The trio looked around, as confused as the moment they walked into this temple.\n    "Oh, I almost forgot, would you like something to drink?" Asinti asked with smile. "We could also plan to do something together soon. I've really started to enjoy hiking," he suggested, patting Leopold on the back. "A bit of exercise wouldn't hurt you or your wings, my friend."\n    Speechless and still processing the bizarre situation, they agreed and followed Asinti to get a drink, hoping it might help them understand their friend's mysterious behavior better."

Silver Star began.\n    "You're stronger than you think," Gąsienica interrupted. "Strength isn't just about physical power. It's about what you do."\n    Silver Star listened, realizing the griffon might be right. He had always thought of strength in terms of magical power, but what was the use of it? Hiding away from the world? Then it hit him — he had heard these words before, from somepony very close to him, but in his pride, he had never truly listened."

  #only first and last needs to be written
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_flavor1:0 "Leopold had a point, taking notes is definitely more practical. What kind of looser carry around a bulky journal all the time anyway?\n\nHopefully, I'll come across something noteworthy soon.\n\n\n\nP.S. I need to investigate anomaly that swallowed my journal."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text1:0 "The Count called us all together for another one of his ridiculous feasts, and afterwards forced us to go on a hunting expedition in the forest. Things were quite dull until we stumbled upon the schematics for a mysterious device. Asinti wanted custody of the ponies that led us to them, the fool, but I ensured that did not happen.\n\nClearly, further investigation into the origin of these schematics will be necessary. Contacting the cult that provided them would be a good place to start."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text2:0 " After questioning members of this cult, I discovered that they believe the schematics originate from the deity they worship. This calls for further questioning into the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text3:0 "The deity cultists worship, the "Great Machine". Quite curious. Contacting Inner Circle cultists will be necessary to discover more about the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text4:0 "After contacting the Inner Circle cultists, I received a very strange vision, possibly from their deity. The vision seemed to indicate that it was withering away and in need of something. What kind of god needs something from mortals?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text5:0 "I have heard word that hostile plants recently attacked the mountain villages, but were ultimately defeated. It would be a good idea for me to travel there and investigate the nature of this strange occurrence."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text6:0 " I visited the mountain villages and recovered samples from the hostile plants that attacked them. While there I met an interesting griffon with a magical trinket which he used to protect the villages. I studied the trinket and the warding spell he cast, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text7:0 " Asinti was grateful enough to provide me with samples of living rock he stumbled upon while constructing his absurd temple. This rock seems to have a will of its own. Quite bizarre..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text8:0 "I feel more confident in making a link between the living rock and the hostile plants. The two are connected, but what power could be behind the corruption of the very earth? I am at a loss."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text9:0 "Perhaps the answers I seek lie beneath the ground? I hear Leopold is conducting quite the excavation..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text10:0 "The Titan of living rock uncovered by Leopold's excavation was obviously a magical construct, but creating it would be well beyond the ability of any living mage. It must have been the same power behind Asinti's living rock and the plants that attacked the mountain villages. It's all connected, I know it, but how? I just need to find one more missing piece... Silver Star's library is the only place in Barrad that might contain answers, but I doubt he would ever let me peruse it voluntarily."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text11:0 "Everything now seems much more clear, the time draws near..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_friendship:0 "Lately, I've been experiencing strange feelings. Those individuals I've been spending time with... I've become quite attached to them. Is it possible that I've started to care about them?\n\No, I can't let these feelings distract me. I must remain committed to my true path."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text12:0 "So it is done. What was once a god now lies under my hoof as a slave, with me ascending to its former position. It's unfortunate that others couldn't accept it.\n\nYet despite the vast powers I've acquired, there remain places beyond my grasp, such as mind  of the cultist's god. Perhaps, by constructing additional reactors, I might find a way to access it?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text13:0 "Yes, yes, yes! I can sense an even greater power flowing through my flesh. It's an exhilarating sensation! Even surpassing the joy I get from sensing ancient entity's fear.\n\nIt's time to teach it that no secrets can be kept from me."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text14:0 "Most fascinating, the entity comprises seven distinct consciousnesses. Yet, these separate entities come together to form a single, unified mind. What a remarkable phenomenon.\n\nThe one I succeeded in accessing revealed to me visions of cities gleaming with gold and rivers flowing with milk and honey. It became apparent that these were not just visions but manifestations of its desires and envy.\n\nCould such promises help me draw more followers while I'll be acquiring power?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text15:0 "Accessing the second consciousness proved to be a more challenging task. It contained vast knowledge but was fiercely protected by a level of greed surpassing that of any griffon or dragon.\n\nDespite the obstacles, it now lies exposed before me, akin to an open book, and I intend to explore its contents thoroughly."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text16:0 "The only word that aptly describes this consciousness is wrath, starkly different from the others. I wonder, has it always been driven by a desire for pain and destruction? Or did it, at some point, become aware of its own potential?\n\nMuch like I have now..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text17:0 "I once believed I understood what of joy and pleasure is, but I was mistaken. The third consciousness inundated me with visions of pure ecstasy, igniting a lust for more.\n\nHowever, I saw through its allure. As tempting as it is to indulge in such pleasures, this experience showed me the importance of not succumbing too easily to the desires of the flesh, reminding me to maintain clarity of thought."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text18:0 "This consciousness exhibits significant diligence and takes pride in its accomplishments. While it's somewhat boring, there's value in self-praise. Fortunately, I can leave the hard work part to others."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text19:0 "It's surprising how creature so powerful can become so indifferent and apathetic.\n\nI must ensure that neither I nor my followers ever find ourselves in a similar condition."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text20:0 "This consciousness would explain  Ambrosius' actions, dominated by hedonistic desires and an insatiable appetite for magic. It's unfortunate it never found a way to quench its thirst for power like I did.\n\nIt makes me wonder if I could use my abilities in reverse to create physical objects on a large scale.\n\nP.S. There has to bo something more I can put into my hooves!"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text21:0 "I barely feel my own flesh anymore, but there is no turning back. I must venture further, even if it means leaving the mortal realm."
