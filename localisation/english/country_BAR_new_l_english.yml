  #TODO: check descriptions below for errors and if they make any sense
  #rewrite if needed
  BAR_friend_state_of_our_home_desc:0 "Chaos reigns supreme in Barrad as the cultists, like ravenous predators, lay waste to lands forgotten by gods. Those who hold any sort of power and influence exploit the turmoil for their own gains. Yet, amidst this tempest of strife, the four unlikely friends plan how to make things right."
  BAR_friend_join_gasienica_desc:0 "As his master teeters on the brink of death, Gąsienica employs every resource at his disposal to uphold the dominion of Ambrosius. Despite a turbulent history marked by fleeting hostilities, aligning forces with him could prove to be a prudent course of action."
  BAR_friend_enemies_within_desc:0 "Ambrosius meticulously crafted a fragile power structure that enabled his secession from Wittenland. With him gone, the entire thing crumbled. To endure and thrive, we must reclaim our dominion over the realm."
  BAR_friend_ultimatum_to_influential_desc:0 "Ambrosius did not have an iron grip on the entire Barrad. Numerous formidable individuals seek to exploit the current chaos, and it becomes imperative for us to assert our dominance and remind them of the true authority."
  BAR_friend_train_local_militias_desc:0 "Ambrosius may not have been benevolent toward his subjects, but Gąsienica sees potential utility in arming them. The notion of empowerment, albeit in the midst of chaos, could play a crucial role in reclaiming control over the tumultuous realm."
  BAR_friend_griffon_friends_desc:0 "In times of need you can count on your friends, and Gąsienica has many friends among his fellow griffons. Yet, the looming question remains - will they accept his recently forged alliances?"
  BAR_friend_welcome_defectors_desc:0 "It seems that some of those who sought to exploit our current situation possess more intelligence that what their previous actions suggested. They've opted to align with our cause, and while a welcome is due, precautions must be taken to secure their unwavering loyalty."
  BAR_friend_operation_tempest_desc:0 "Time is running short. We must assemble our allies and embark on an armed campaign against every last potential threat against our rule in Barrad."
  BAR_friend_operation_lomnica_desc:0 "Banditry a persistent scourge of Barrad, requires an unwavering response. Collaborating with our recent allies among the common ponies, we shall embark on a sweeping operation across the countryside, ensuring the eradication of this menace once and for all.."
  BAR_friend_prepare_reactor_ignition_desc:0 "Amidst all challenges, we must persist in pursuing our objectives. The potential power from the reactor could hold the key to resolving the problems we confront. Yet, with each step forward, doubts linger and multiply..."
  BAR_friend_ignite_reactor_desc:0 "Our path forward is unobstructed, and we shall proceed with our plans towards reactor. If the gods harbor any concern for us mere mortals, may their watchful eyes be upon us.."
  BAR_friend_meet_ambrosius_desc:0 "The Mad Count has awoken from what seemed to be an eternal slumber, but he changed. No more do his halls resound with maniacal laughter and hedonistic revelry, instead his voice now beared the tones of reason. And he seeks an audience."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_desc:0 "Merely fending off cultist assaults and raids is a futile endeavor. We must seize the initiative and confront them on their own territory, maintaining relentless pressure."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_mountains_desc:0 "Within our mountains lies countless underground structures, whether formed naturally, excavated by diamond dogs, or shaped by other forces. If these depths harbor cultists, we must either subdue them or entomb all within beneath layers of unyielding rock.."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_elysium_desc:0 "Elysium the largest city in Barrad, harbors a subtle cultist enclave. While not overtly violent, this cell engages in covert acts of sabotage and other clandestine activities that elude our knowledge. It demands our decisive intervention."
  BAR_friend_cultist_strongholds_roughers_desc:0 "The eastern forests are great for two purposes, concealing and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Barrad. Both we and the cultists are well aware of this, emphasizing the need to thwart their covert operations."
  BAR_friend_occupy_grand_sanctuary_desc:0 "The grand sanctuary evokes the most unsettling feelings. The last encounter Pentarchy and Gąsienica had within its sacred halls involved a battle to liberate Ambrosius. Yet, upon departing, a lingering sense that something crucial had been overlooked has persisted to this very day. Now, they are compelled to rectify it..."
  BAR_friend_enemies_without_desc:0 "We find ourselves inadequately equipped for the impending conflict, yet it will come, whether we desire it or not. Perhaps launching an offensive against our adversaries before they amass greater power than us is the best option we have."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_desc:0 "It is beyond doubt that our southern neighbor will inevitably launch an assault. Observing the rapid expansion of their industrial might, it would be wiser to engage in conflict sooner rather than later."
  BAR_friend_attack_zes_bonus_desc:0 "We must press forward, in the face of potential defeat, the cost becomes inconsequential."
  BAR_friend_convert_factories_desc:0 "Our resources are primarily tailored for internal conflicts. We must maximize their utility to the fullest extent possible for the incoming war."
  BAR_friend_seize_factories_desc:0 "Barrad harbors weapon manufacturers, predominantly catering to the black market in other nations. To stand any chance against external threats, we must seize control of their enterprises."
  BAR_friend_employ_mercenaries_desc:0 "Despite Gąsienica's disdain for mercenaries, numerous groups operate in our region, and undoubtedly those recruits will prove useful."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_desc:0 "Austurland's intentions remain uncertain, but Gąsienica believes that abandoning them would leave our flank vulnerable in the event of a potential conflict with the River Federation. It appears we must take a gamble..."
  BAR_friend_attack_olv_bonus_desc:0 "Our current predicament has turned us into cornered animals, and so we must embrace that essence. With all of its ferocity."
  BAR_friend_fortify_border_desc:0 "Having secured our southern border, the imperative now lies in fortifying the western frontier to dissuade any potential invasions. May it allow us to focus our efforts on any potential threat from Riverlands."
  BAR_friend_light_of_the_star_desc:0 "In recent weeks, a cascade of unforeseen events unfolded. In his mastery of the unpredictable, Ambrosius seized the opportunity to introduce yet another layer of the unexpected. For better or worse, it is to be seen."
  BAR_friend_prince_of_wittenland_desc:0 "Much to his surprise, the ponies of Barrad responded positively upon learning that Silver Star had assumed leadership of the county. Perhaps they harbor hopes of a reunion with Wittenland, or maybe their trust is placed in the belief that he would govern akin to his sister."
  BAR_friend_letter_to_sister_desc:0 "Silver Star summoned the necessary courage to start writing a letter to his sister, a gesture that piqued the curiosity of certain deer."
  BAR_friend_fight_for_friendship_desc:0 "Even in the darkest recesses of his nightmares, Silver Star never envisioned the prospect of losing someone dear to him. Until now, he hadn't deemed anyone worthy of risking his life for. Yet, an unfamiliar power surges through his veins, filling him with determination to fight for the sake of his friends"
  BAR_friend_move_to_wittenburgh_desc:0 "Even with the Wittenland crown secured, our Riverland neighbors understandably still harbor suspicions about us. Perhaps relocating to Wittenburgh could dispell the notion of us being mere invaders and fostering trust."
  BAR_friend_serving_justice_desc:0 "Silver Star has learned how forgive for many transgressions, yet sororicide stands resolute outside the bounds of pardon. Unfortunately for those in Wittenland, he has also acquired the art of confronting challenges and not evading the responsibility"
  BAR_friend_homecoming_desc:0 "Victory is ours; the interlopers have been expelled from Wittenland. Now is the moment to unfurl the banner of three crowns across the lands."
  BAR_friend_river_federation_membership_desc:0 "Our circumstances are curious, for Wittenland long stood as a member of the River Federation. With our newfound rule, does this entitle us to membership as well? We must find out."
  BAR_friend_viira_and_silver_diplomacy_desc:0 "Silver Star found himself ill-prepared for the multifaceted challenges of governance, with diplomacy proving to be a particularly formidable adversary. Fortunately, no obstacle exists that cannot be overcome with the support of a friend."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff_desc:0 "Even united both Wittenland and Barrad lacked the economic prowess observed in the nations to the far west. Perhaps we could ask for some assistance?"
  BAR_friend_evi_griffons_diplomacy_desc:0 "Despite the well-known tensions between Wittenland and the griffons in the west, and Silver Star's personal reservations towards them, it seems imperative to extend a symbolic gesture of friendship in an effort to thaw the icy relations."
  BAR_friend_beg_for_stuff2_desc:0 "Neither Viira nor Silver Star possess extensive experience in the realm of business, but everypony has to begin somewhere as securing foreign investments could significantly benefit us."
  BAR_friend_diplomacy_getting_somebody_competent_desc:0 "Despite their earnest intentions and best efforts, the two friends found themselves empty-hoofed after their diplomatic endeavor. Fortunately, there are more seasoned individuals just waiting to be called upon for assistance."
  BAR_friend_riverlands_diplomacy_desc:0 "Ambrosius appeared genuinely surprised that it took Silver Star this long to seek his assistance. Though when he was his age, he likely preferred spending time with mares rather than a leader of a rogue state."
  BAR_friend_merchant_dynasty_desc:0 "Ambrosius' immense fortune was not meticulously built from scratch; he inherited it, just as his father did before him, and countless others in his lineage. Each sought to pass on more than they received, and Ambrosius emerged as perhaps the shrewdest among them all."
  BAR_friend_one_hoof_washes_the_other_desc:0 "To get something from somepony, you must present an enticing offer aligned with their desires. However, exercise caution not to overtly reveal your intentions, for that might prompt them to demand more. It's a rather straightforward principle, wouldn't you agree, my young friend?"
  BAR_friend_buy_our_stuff_desc:0 "Barrad harbors abundant untapped resources that could serve as a valuable asset. Our endeavor should focus on securing potential buyers to feed into our burgeoning industrial pursuits."
  BAR_friend_silver_tongue_desc:0 "Ambrosius possesses exceptional gifts, and among them, his extraordinary social skills stand out. There is no being in existence with whom he cannot initiate a conversation, delving deep until a profound acquaintance is established."
  BAR_friend_regional_interventionism_desc:0 "To everypony's surprise, White Star was not only willig to assist her brother in ruling after losing her crown but also exhibited enthusiasm for the role. Perhaps shedding the constraints of monarchy played a part, or she simply reveled in the return of her sibling. Regardless, she advised adopting a more proactive stance in regional diplomacy, acknowledging that blood had already been spilled."
  BAR_friend_conquer_steppe_desc:0 "Those steppe griffons are impervious to reason. We need a swift resolution to prevent any future raids into our lands."
  BAR_friend_aproach_cossacs_desc:0 "As the government shifts on the steppe, an opportunity arises to cultivate alliances and safeguard our heartland from potential raids."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_deal_desc:0 "Grifofns in Gryphus always were well wersed in buissness, they surely will understand importance of cooperation between our countries for our mutual security and potentialy proserity."
  BAR_friend_free_towns_not_for_long_desc:0 "Gryphus looms as a potantial threat, demanding our attention before it spirals beyond control. Surprisingly, there is a measure of support for this prospective invasion, particularly among Ambrosius' feathered friends from the southern moutains."
  BAR_friend_bandits_and_communists_desc:0 "Communist uprisings, erratic rulers, famine. By venturing into those lands, we extend a favor to the griffons. Simultaneously, we thwart a looming threat to our region."
  BAR_friend_lushi_ultimatum_desc:0 "The gateway to absolute peace in Evi Valley lies in the small nation of Lushi. A diplomatic approach to persuade them to join our cause is advisable. However, it must be made explicitly clear that rejecting our proposal will carry significant consequences."
  BAR_friend_bring_order_to_helquil_desc:0 "Our attention seldom graced that distant realm. Yet, as our sphere of influence extended to this place forsaken by spirits, intervention became imperative."
  BAR_friend_ruin_has_come_desc:0 "Ruin has come to Barrad. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed lands. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth as we were spreading the realm of death and madness! But it can be reclaimed from the ravenous clutching shadows, rebuild into new house, opulent and imperial."
  BAR_friend_now_what_desc:0 "The mantle of rulership rests uneasy on Silver Star's shoulders, a responsibility he never envisioned. Amidst the recent tumultuous events, he finds himself adrift and overwhelmed. Fortunately, steadfast friends stand ready to guide him through the uncharted waters."
  BAR_friend_2_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy's reign, strength dictated supremacy - a simplistic rule leading to inevitable chaos when the strongest vanished. It becomes imperative to forge new societal structure, one rooted in collaboration rather than fear."
  BAR_friend_3_desc:0 "Despite the turmoil, the inhabitants of Barrad share more common ground than they realize. With the alleviation of constant fear and strugge for basic resources, it becomes imperative for them to rekindle the sense of unity they have seemingly forgotten."
  BAR_friend_4_desc:0 "Collaboration holds its merit, but it was trust that steered Pentarchy away from its dark course. This invaluable lesson gradually permeates the understanding of the common ponies too."
  BAR_friend_5_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad diligently toil, liberated from oppressive rule, banditry, and cultist influence. They rebuild infrastructure, rejuvenate trade, and witness the resurgence of circulated goods."
  BAR_friend_6_desc:0 "When working together we can exchange not only what we need to survive but also ideas that comes to our mind. It seems live two sided sword considering that cooperation between pentarchs focused on building a reactor leaded to time of strive, but it also holds much potential for good."
  BAR_friend_7_desc:0 "The ponies of Barrad have proven to be remarkably innovative, perhaps driven by the scarcity of basic resources. With the elimination of survival concerns, their ingenuity can now be harnessed for more constructive purposes."
  BAR_friend_8_desc:0 "Having savored the fruits of prosperity and freedom, our populace will not relinquish them without a fight. To meet the demand for self-defense, numerous new arms manufacturers have commenced their operations."
  BAR_friend_first_census_desc:0 "Asinti harbors ambivalent sentiments about the situation they find themselves in. On one hoof, he yearns to place his trust in his friend Silver Star and the purported transformation within him. On the other, he grapples with the realization that they are inadvertently perpetuating a broken system he had sworn to dismantle. The notion of a census might serve as a feeble pretext, yet it stands as a potential means to quell the disquieting thoughts that assail him."
  BAR_friend_country_side_census_desc:0 "Silent and mostly serene, the fields and hills of Barrad provide an ideal sanctuary for contemplation, where one can ruminate on past actions and deliberate upon the course of future endeavors."
  BAR_friend_infrastructure_desc:0 "Traveling from settlement to settlement posed a perpetual challenge in Barrad, unless for those with wings. Asinti pondered why local communities couldn't unite to address this issue, constructing roads and bridges for their collective benefit. The notion lingered prominently in Asinti's mind."
  BAR_friend_many_cultures_of_barrad_desc:0 "Traversing the hilltops of Barrad left Asinti and his followers in awe of similarities and subtle distinctions among the various communities. Despite the pervasive influence of cultist beliefs in this region, the diversity observed proved both unsettling and inspiring, showcasing resilience amid the challenging circumstances faced by these inhabitants."
  BAR_friend_common_undestanding_desc:0 "Despite their long stay in Barrad, encountering a zebra remained an extraordinary event for most locals. Consequently, as they traveled, Asinti and his followers found themselves frequently sought after for assistance or guidance. Word spread from village to village, gradually turning the attention of many towards the striped preacher and his teachings for the common folk."
  BAR_friend_visit_in_asinti_temple_desc:0 "Lately Asinti has exhibited a noticeable change. He dedicates more hours to his temple, engages in fewer conversations, and wanders about contemplating. We should investigate the nature of his activities within the temple."
  BAR_friend_clockwork_asisted_work_desc:0 "Lot of workon the countryside is manual labor. Asinti suggested to Leopold that they could change it using his clockwork machines."
  BAR_friend_land_reclamation_desc:0 "Much of the labor in rural Barrad involves manual toil. Asinti proposed to Leopold the prospect of transforming this scenario through the utilization of his clockwork machines."
  BAR_friend_anti_anomaly_work_desc:0 "In a realm rife with magical anomalies, the term "normal life" loses its meaning. Asinti recognizes the challenge it poses for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of magic. He believes it's his duty not to abandon these people in their struggle against such formidable issues."
  BAR_friend_civ_industry_desc:0 "Having traversed the lands, Asinti couldn't dismiss the plight of the ponies enduring subpar conditions in Barrad. Enlisting the aid of his friends, he contemplates orchestrating community-driven construction initiatives to elevate the standards of housing."
  BAR_friend_mil_industry_desc:0 "As Asinti tells his stories of the struggle for freedom and the imperative of emancipation thought strenght of a unit, a curious development transpires: the common ponies starts enlarging previously estabilished local militias. Like mushrooms sprouting after rainfall, fresh factories emerge to satiate this burgeoning appetite for strenght."
  BAR_friend_dev_up_desc:0 "Asinti couldn't recall the last time he felt a genuine sense of accomplishment. He perpetually pursued an elusive ideals, a spirit that defied capture the closer he approached. How many beings did he overlook in his relentless pursuit? Some of the zebras who come with him to Griffonia now had fillies, and even grand-fillies. He used to cherish them, took care of the young, aid those in need... now he can't even remember their names. Battling his inner demons, Asinti began to undestand the true nature of the tragedy he got himself into. But there is still time and hope, as long as you have friends by your side."
  BAR_friend_barradian_academy_of_applied_science_desc:0 "Leopold refused to surrender his lifelong obsession easily. Despite Silver Star's rejection of the proposal to reconstruct the reactor and ascend to the divine status akin to alicorn princesses in the distant west, Leopold resolved to explore alternative avenues to achieve his objective. Perhaps taking a step back was essential, assembling proficient individuals from Barrad and beyond might kindle a fresh spark of inspiration."
  BAR_friend_electrical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Electricity briefly captivated Leopold, as he speculated on its immense potential, despite its inability to rival mechanical energy as a machinery power source and appearing nearly redundant in the realm of magical engineering, he sensed that there might be overlooked possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mechanical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "Good old cogs and bolts, the force propelling the world forward. Since constructing an automated peeler to assist his mother during his early days, Leopold had devoted his life to crafting increasingly remarkable automatons. Yet, even with a lifetime of accumulated knowledge and expertise, an external perspective might unveil something valuable."
  BAR_friend_magical_engineering_faculty_desc:0 "In the realm of griffon researchers, scientists and inventors, Leopold stood as a paragon of arcane knowledge, with only a few who could rival him. His inventions were unmatched. However, throughout history, there were instances when somegriff entirely unfamiliar with the subject stumbled upon what others considered impossible. This might be one such case."
  BAR_friend_renowned_genius_desc:0 "Leopold found it unsurprising that many sought to collaborate with him or learn from his expertise. However, what truly astonished him was the wealth of knowledge he acquired through these collaborations. It offered a new perspective on the vastness of what he had yet to learn."
  BAR_friend_high_automation_desc:0 "Due to influx of new ideas and guidance of Asinti and Leopold new levels of automation was achieved in Barrad both in industry and agriculture."
  BAR_friend_sharing_knowledge_of_arcane_desc:0 "With the newfound approach of not hoarding knowledge like a precious treasure, the realm witnessed ideas and discoveries blossoming like flowers in the spring."
  BAR_friend_invite_other_to_study_magic_desc:0 "Once a secluded nation, safeguarding our magical secrets from the external world. Yet, now a deep feeling urges us to unveil the secrets of magic that we've unraveled throughout the passing years. Perhaps, in turn, the outside world may reciprocate this gesture of goodwill?"
  BAR_friend_everything_will_be_fine_desc:0 "The long journey weighed heavily on everyone in Barrad, particularly on the five pentarchs. However, one among them harbors deep concerns about the uncertainties the future might unfold. Are these apprehensions justified?"
  BAR_friend_agriculture_mechanization_desc:0 "Amidst intense negotiations and myriad conversations, Asinti successfully persuaded Leopold to embark on the ambitious undertaking he envisioned. The aspiration? To propel the Barradian countryside into a contemporary era where the toil of muscles becomes obsolete. A vision where common folk not only sustain themselves from the land but also contribute to the welfare of their entire communities."
  BAR_new_southern_friends_desc:0 "The fear among the creatures of Kasa was palpable, expecting conquest and enslavement, only to find our arrival upon their shores. We lack the necessary administrative infrastructure, the goodwill of the locals, and even a legitimate claim to these lands. Governing will prove to be a interesting challenge indeed."
  BAR_kasa_1_desc:0 "Numerous among our subjects have sought refuge in Kasa, drawn by its promises of sanctuary. Understandable, indeed. Yet, with our newfound commitment to change, this exodus could prove beneficial to our governance in those territories."
  BAR_kasa_2_desc:0 "As our coastline extends, the naval industry emerges as a pivotal component in safeguarding our security and asserting strategic dominance over maritime trade routes."
  BAR_kasa_3_desc:0 "Ambrosius advocates for a close intertwining of the economies of Barrad and Kasa, lest we spawn a parallel economic structure. There might be merit in it."
  BAR_kasa_4_desc:0 "Kasa has never had a robust network of land connections to Barrad, a fact that seemed inconsequential during our isolation. However, the time has come to alter this circumstance."
  BAR_kasa_5_desc:0 "The Kasans are a proud creatures, unyielding in their freedom. Surprisingly, we have no intention of challenging this aspect of their nature. Granting them a measure of autonomy seems only reasonable, the least we can offer."
  BAR_kasa_6_desc:0 "The passage of time has seen our southern border extend to the sea. For the Kasans, we have proven not to be the monsters they once feared, nor mere invaders seeking plunder. Perhaps the merging of our two realms is now within reach."
  BAR_our_deer_friends_desc:0 "The eastern deers have long been a source of trouble, their presence a thorn in the side of peace and stability. Perhaps it is in the best interest of all, ourselves included, that they now fall under our dominion?"
  BAR_olv_1_desc:0 "In a surge of inspiration, Silver Star suggested a course rarely taken with our neighbor: dialogue. Could there be reasonable minds among the deers, waiting to be heard and understood?"
  BAR_olv_2_desc:0 "It is had to distinguish what once stood there, and destruction wrought by our invasion. Regardless, it falls upon us to offer both resources and direction in the reconstruction efforts."
  BAR_olv_3_desc:0 "As befits a nation forged in the crucible of conflict, the craft of weaponry holds sway over both  society and economy. With strategic vision and ample resources, the arms industry may flourish, while casting us in a favorable light."
  BAR_olv_4_desc:0 "Never before have we found reason to link our realms, save for the occasional exchange of local goods across the river. Today, however, marks a shift in this paradigm."
  BAR_olv_5_desc:0 "In the absence of a reliable local administrative framework, our efforts to govern these lands demand heightened attention. We must exert ourselves doubly to ensure that the deers heed our counsel and guidance."
  BAR_olv_6_desc:0 ""Like it or not, we are here to stay" said Gąsienica when adressing grievances of the local lord."
  BAR_new_south_desc:0 "Amidst the vast disparities among the three southern realms, by magic or miracle we have succeeded in creating a semblance of governance. Remarkably, the inhabitants therein appear to coexist, if not with fervent affection, then at least with a glimmer of friendship."
  BAR_friend_miliatry_reform_desc:0 "From the moment he ascended to his position, Gąsienica persistently implored Ambrosius to form a substantial military force for the defense of both himself and the realm. However, intricate and sensitive political dynamics that led to Ambrosius' rise thwarted these pleas. Now, with the entire county in disarray, there is no rationale against establishing a formidable army."
  BAR_friend_desperate_employment_desc:0 "The core of our new military force lies what was once Ambrosius' personal army, yet we require additional soldiers to reinforce their ranks swiftly. Fortunately, a multitude of our subjects willingly steps forward to combat the deranged cultists who threaten to engulf their homes in flames."
  BAR_friend_employ_adventurers_desc:0 "Gąsienica harbors contempt for those self-proclaimed adventurers traversing the realm stirring up strife. However, with the allure of gold and glory, they can be swayed to lend their services as mercenaries."
  BAR_friend_scavenger_army_desc:0 "In our dearth of essential equipment, our primary focus must shift to the retrieval of weaponry from our vanquished adversaries."
  BAR_friend_wake_up_sleeping_knights_desc:0 "In his younger days Gąsienica heard legends of griffon knights sleeping in the mountains, awaiting to be called in the hour of need. One can only wonder if the legends are true, but the hour of need surely had come."
  BAR_friend_convince_dragons_desc:0 "Nestled within our mountains lie dormant dragons, guarding their treasures in the deepest of caverns. Ordinarily, rousing these majestic creatures would be a perilous endeavor, requiring the expertise of formidable mages. However, Gąsienica holds firm in his conviction that the second most potent force in the world, gold, can manage this situation and get us some allies."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The arms borne by our soldiers could easily find a place within the annals of a museum. It becomes imperative to embark on the development of modern weapon systems."
  BAR_friend_engineers_recon_desc:0 "Barrad terrain demands precision in troop movement, requiring an in-depth understanding of the obstacles and challenges that lie ahead."
  BAR_friend_engineer_corps_desc:0 "Given our modest forces, the strategic integration of field fortifications becomes imperative to level the playing field."
  BAR_friend_logistic_desc:0 "Count Ambrosius' forces sustained themselves through the land, a method effective when they functioned as mere thugs. However, for a modern army, this approach proves insufficient."
  BAR_friend_radio_desc:0 "Barrad hosts swift messengers, with Gąsienica being a prime example. However, the crucial skill of coordinating military operations across vast areas is one we cannot overlook. The future belongs to the radio."
  BAR_friend_anti_air_desc:0 "Competing in air warfare against nations with superior production capabilities poses a formidable challenge. Our strategy should pivot towards negating the aerial advantage of our adversaries through the deployment of anti-air equipment."
  BAR_friend_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "Gąsienica firmly belives in the crucial role of regular soldiers during the battle, and to maximize their utility they need as powerfull weapons as we can provide them."
  BAR_friend_anti_tank_desc:0 "To adequately bolster our troops, we must furnish them with the capability to engage heavily armored adversaries."
  BAR_friend_artillery_desc:0 "Our current deficiency lies in the absence of suitable artillery to reinforce the advancement of our soldiers. We must prioritize the development of this arm or risk finding ourselves incapable of breaking through enemy lines."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_desc:0 "We must mobilize additional production capabilities to ensure a continuous supply of new equipment for our troops."
  BAR_friend_artillery_2_desc:0 "Not so long ago consulting Ambrosius, Leopold, or Viira regarding anything related to weaponry would undoubtedly yield the sentiment that bigger equates to better. There could be some merit in that."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_2_desc:0 "Currently our industrial capacity adequately provides the weaponry we require. However, there is a pressing need to consider expanding our existing factories to enhance our resilience in the event of disruptions to the supply lines."
  BAR_friend_light_tanks_desc:0 "Possessing armored units undoubtedly bestows a strategic advantage, but their utility in mountainous terrain remains limited. Nevertheless, there is merit in exploring the possibility of developing lighter variants capable of navigating challenging landscapes."
  BAR_friend_rocket_experiments_desc:0 "Leopold has developed interesting plans for a novel form of projectile propulsion. Although its strategic applications within our armed forces are still limited, delving into this field could unveil untapped possibilities."
  BAR_friend_mil_buildup_3_desc:0 "As our weapons become increasingly sophisticated, our factories must expand to accommodate the rising production costs."
  BAR_friend_medium_tanks_desc:0 "After a series of tests with light armored vehicles, it became evident that they cannot fulfill the role we envisioned for them. A new tank design must be created, featuring enhanced firepower and armor, yet remaining light enough to navigate challenging terrain."
  BAR_friend_independent_military_units_desc:0 "Empowering smaller units with significant autonomy in their operations provides them with heightened flexibility and better adaptability to fulfill their assigned missions. This approach also alleviates the burden on higher command, allowing Gąsienica to oversee more things simultaneously."
  BAR_friend_mountaineers_desc:0 "While most of our soldiers know very well hot to live and fight in mountains and hills of Barrad we still can select individuals that do it best and form specialized divisions."
  BAR_friend_mountain_expertise_desc:0 "Born amidst these towering peaks, destined to draw our final breaths amidst their rugged embrace. We are the but a humble children of these mountains, none know their terrain as we do, none are as adept in the art of warfare amid their craggy expanse."
  BAR_friend_conscription_system_desc:0 "For too long, Barrad has relied upon hastily raised levies, hired swords, or scant bands of seasoned warriors. It is time we forge a more dependable foundation. A system of conscription must be erected, binding our people to the defense of their homeland."
  BAR_friend_harmonic_conscription_system_desc:0 "Change sweeps over us like a gap wind, reshaping the very rock beneath our paws and hooves. No longer must we compel our people into the ranks of our army. Instead, they flock to our banners willingly, their fervor burning bright as the star."
  BAR_friend_mil_factories_desc:0 "In these turbulent times, the demands upon our army for equipment are ceaseless. We must possess the capacity to meet these demands without fail."
  BAR_friend_equipment_simplification_desc:0 "In the annals of Barrad's history, prosperity has been but a distant dream. Yet, from the crucible of hardship, our creatures have honed a skill indispensable in the craft of weaponry -  the art of resourcefulness."
  BAR_friend_air_warfare_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, winged beings understood the significance of commanding the aerial domain in the theater of war. And as ages changes, so too must our methods evolve to secure this crucial advantage."
  BAR_friend_light_planes_desc:0 "Much akin to the griffon soaring aloft, the machine designed to dominate the sky must possess swiftness and agility as its foremost attributes."
  BAR_friend_tac_bomber_desc:0 "To hold dominance over the sky is but a part of the equation, the capacity to project power from it is a different matter that warrants our attention."
  BAR_friend_air_accidents_prevention_desc:0 "The skies above Barrad are fraught with perilous magical anomalies. It behooves us to provide our pilots with the necessary training to navigate such treacherous enviroment."
  BAR_friend_plane_factories_desc:0 "To secure aerial supremacy over the battlefield, we must establish specialized factories solely dedicated to the production of new aircraft."

  BAR_friend_white_star_is_helping_tooltip:0 "White Star is here to help her brother."
  BAR_fix_the_climate_tooltip:0 "Effects of Barrad climate will be less severe."

  barrad_first.1.t:0 "The Invitation"
  barrad_first.1.d:0 "Deep in his study on a stormy night, Count Ambrosius paced in candlelight, dictating a letter to an enormous seated griffon. "Dear friend," began Ambrosius. "I extend to you an invitation to attend a great celebration. The most esteemed creatures of the land will be in attendance, and together we shall witness amazing wonders, the likes of which have never before been conceived!" Just saying the words made Ambrosius hop in excitement. "Come to my manor at once so that we may begin the festivities. Your friend, Count Ambrosius I." The griffon struggled to keep up with Ambrosius' words, scribbling as fast as he could onto a piece of parchment. "Oh this will be fun. So fun!" laughed Ambrosius.\n\nThe griffon finished writing and looked up to Ambrosius. "Who should receive this message?" The Count stood still, not acknowledging the question at all. "The Pentarchy?" asked the griffon.\n\n"Pentarchy. Pentarchy..." Ambrosius stared off into nothingness, trailing off for a moment. "Well, we simply must have Viira. Her extraordinary talents will help us greatly." Ambrosius tapped his chin. "And Leopold. To deny our party a mind like his would simply not do at all! He shall be there. Silver Star, on the other hoof..." The Count's face twisted in disgust. "Very rude guest. We could do without him. And... what was that old zebra's name again?"\n\nThe griffon unhooked a vial of liquid from around his neck and offered it to Ambrosius, who greedily took a swig. The Count blinked several times before glancing around the room. "Thank you, Gąsienica." He sighed and sunk into a chair. "Yes. Send it to the Pentarchy.""
  barrad_first.1.a:0 "We'll have a grand old time!"
  barrad_first.3.t:0 "Gathering the Nobles"
  barrad_first.3.d:0 "The Count gathered the rest of the Pentarchy in his manor. Expecting a party, they were surprised to hear the Count giving them an order: to gather the other nobles of the realm. The four begrudgingly accepted began to walk off, when, out of nowhere Cpt.Gąsienica offerred to do the job himself. The Pentarchy was surprised, but when they recollected, they gladly gave him the job."
  barrad_first.3.a:0 "Off to get this mess together."
  barrad_first.4.t:0 "The Feast"
  barrad_first.4.d:0 "The Count rose before the nobles and other Pentarchy members gathered in his manor. He began to speak, thanking them all for their presence. He gleefully told them of the great hunt that he had arranged. The nobles were ecstatic and pressed the Count to tell them more. He told them that there was much game in the woods, and that it was only increasing in number.\n\nHe then announced in a loud voice, "And so, dear friends, it is time to poach this game, in a grand hunt!" Speaking in a softer tone, he said, "But before the hunt can begin, we must first feast to prepare our spirits for such a spectacle. Today, you will see before you the most exquisite food and vintage drink that I could produce. Let us dine, then, to our health, and to glory!"\n\n"To glory!", exclaimed the nobles, who quickly set about to devouring the food brought before them, before downing it with copious amounts of wine and beer.\n\nAs the Count prepared to dine, Silver Star nervously asked to be excused. The Count reluctantly allowed him to go, before returning to his meal and mug."
  barrad_first.4.a:0 "A truly excellent feast!"
  barrad_first.5.t:0 "The Hunt"
  barrad_first.5.d:0 "The day after the feast, the Count rallied the hunters. He distributed high-grade weapons, produced in Leopold's forge, he then told them about the game they were to find. With all of the Pentarchy members arriving in the space of a few hours, the hunting party, numbering about a hundred members, set out from Ambrosius' manor. They began to trek into the woods, killing any lone adventurers and small bands they found, as well as a few unfortunate peasants. They went on for hours killing over a dozen ponies and griffons in the woods and putting their bodies in a wagon that Asinti ordered be dragged along with the party. Even Silver Star, in spite of his nervous disposition, was able to kill a few adventurers, for which he was lauded by his allies, especially Ambrosius.\n\nThe party had begun to turn back, when they heard a noise off to the side. The Pentarchy, along with a few dozen nobles went off to find out what the cause of it was, whilst the others guarded their bounty. When the expedition came to the source, they found a well-sized band of adventurers preparing to execute a small number of oddly dressed ponies. The expedition quickly cut down the adventurers and captured the robed ponies. They returned to the main party and continued back to the manor."
  barrad_first.5.a:0 "What a great bounty indeed!"
  barrad_first.51.t:0 "The Discovery"
  barrad_first.51.d:0 "After sorting out their bounty, and having yet another feast, most of the nobles retired to their own estates, and the peasants were set free. The Pentarchy quickly assembled to address the elephant in the room, the captured ponies. Asinti pleaded for them to be given to him, to which Viira responded, "Don't you have enough, doctor?" Ambrosius quickly silenced them before stating his own plan:\n\n"It is clear that we know very little about these strange ponies. I am dying to know more about them. I propose that we interrogate them, to find out who or even what they are."\n\nThe other Pentarchy members nodded in agreement. The ponies were briefly interrogated, before they offered to show the magistrates their meeting place. The ponies showed the Pentarchy into a cave containing all sorts of mysterious inscriptions. It was rightfully assumed that these were members of some sort of ancient cult. The last thing the cultists presented was a series of runes that looked like instruction for some kind of device. The type of device was completely beyond the Pentarchy members, and even the cultists had little knowledge of it. Sated with this knowledge, the Pentarchy split up, with Silver Star racing back to his tower, Asinti and Viira engaging in a lengthy argument, Leopold trying to figure out how the device worked, and Ambrosius drinking a few pints of ale, before passing out on his throne."

  barrad_first.6.d:0 "After scouring through half of Elysium looking for him, Leopold got the brilliant idea to search Silver Star's tower. Upon reaching the tower, they were interrogated at length about their intentions. Half an hour later, they were let in. They entered the mage's room, only to find it empty. The two groaned and turned around to leave. They were walking past the large closet in the room when Asinti heard something.\n\n"Did you hear that scratching, Leopold? It sounded like it was coming from the closet. Surely he wouldn't"...\n\n"Where else would he possibly go?"\n\n"The bathroom, like any other sensible creature."\n\nAsinti burst the closet wide open to reveal a whimpering and petrified Silver Star. Silver fell out like a piece of timber, with Leopold barely breaking his fall. He set the unicorn down on the floor gently, and then walked over to Asinti.\n\n"How are we going to convince him to come with us?"\n\n"Don't worry, I've got this under control."\n\nAsinti proceeded to make loud sounds at Silver, telling him about a terrifying band of cossacks in the woods that they were about to hunt and that the Count wanted Silver to lead the party. Leopold, witnessing Silver's increasing fear, pushed Asinti aside, and began to reassure Silver that there were no cossacks and that the Count only wanted to see him. Silver slowly got up and left with them, though very timidly. Asinti and Leopold followed, and the griffon loudly scolded Asinti for his poor behavior."

barrad_second.1.t:0 "Matters"
  barrad_second.1.d:0 "In the study of Count Ambrosius, the other four members of the Pentarchy sat around a table, contemplating the strange events they had witnessed. "Since our brave Count is currently incapacitated, it is up to us to decipher the meaning of this." Viira placed the mysterious codex down on the table. "We need a plan of action," she said, glancing at each of her compatriots. Leopold paid her no mind, continuing to study the inscriptions he had copied from the cave. Asinti's eyes were closed and his head bobbed slowly. Was he sleeping? Silver Star scowled and grabbed the codex with his magic.\n\n"I am certain that one of the ancient books in my possession will have the information needed to understand these runes," said Silver Star, narrowing his eyes. "I would never allow any of YOU to get a peek at my library, though." He shifted his gaze around the room, suspiciously. "That would be unwise. Very unwise," he muttered to himself.\n\nLeopold waved a dismissive claw. "If we put our minds to it, we can figure this out on our own. No need for any of your obscure, dusty texts," he said matter-of-factly. Silver Star pursed his lips and pushed the codex back to the middle of the table.\n\n"That would take too long, Leopold. We have to go to the source of this." Viira tapped the codex. "We need to get in contact with the cult, so we can question them and find out more," she said. Her tone left no room for argument; it was clearly an order, not a suggestion.\n\n"No." A raspy voice arose. "I can hear their whispers." Asinti looked at Viira with wide eyes. "Yes, we should track down the cult. But not to question them, to kidnap them! Their sacrifice will please the ones beyond." His face broke into a wide smile. The other three eyed Asinti in silence."
  barrad_second.1.a:0 "What to do..."
  barrad_second.2.t:0 "A Wonderful Idea"
  barrad_second.2.d:0 "As morning sunlight filtered in through clouded windows, Count Ambrosius emerged from his bedchamber and stretched. Standing guard by the entrance, Gąsienica was ready to greet him. "Feeling better, sir?"\n\n"Yes, incredibly!" Ambrosius laughed and slapped Gąsienica's back. "You know, it's been so dull around here lately." He began trotting through the halls of the manor with Gąsienica keeping pace at his side. "But that party was invigorating. Hunting! Killing! Mystery! So much excitement..." Ambrosius stroked his beard in contemplation. "I know what we must do: throw another party, bigger and grander." The Count was positively giddy by the time he entered the throne room.\n\n"More drinking, more feasting, more merriment!" Ambrosius was smiling just imagining the festivities. "Begin preparations at once! Send out invitations to the Pentarchy, and all the nobles." He slowly turned to face Gąsienica, his smile remaining but his eyes becoming dark. "And make sure our guests know that refusing to attend will have severe consequences.""
  barrad_second.2.a:0 "Let's break out the booze!"
  barrad_second.3.t:0 "Now You See Them..."
  barrad_second.3.d:0 ""You've never- Unbelievable! You simply must witness it," Ambrosius implored the group of nobles around him, before turning to wave across the hall. "Viira, care to entertain our guests?" he shouted. The doe sighed, and began to walk toward the balcony. Ambrosius galloped to join her and beckoned for the group to follow. From the manor's balcony the two looked over a nearby village, as well as the untamed forests and mountains in the distance. Ambrosius pointed to the village watchtower. "There, that's a good spot."\n\nViira focused intensely before closing her eyes. A strange energy could be felt in the air around her, and the seer's robes began to ripple with magical power. Suddenly, a large section of the village surrounding the tower became shrouded in a dark fog. When the fog dissipated, everything that had been inside it was gone. "Spectacular!" shouted one of the guests, as the rest of them mumbled in amazement. "Where did it all go?" asked another.\n\nViira smirked. "A magician never reveals her secrets.""
  barrad_second.3.a:0 "...now you don't."
  barrad_second.4.t:0 "Listen"
  barrad_second.4.d:0 "In a musty cellar, Viira stood surrounded by a wall of figures shrouded in shadow. In front of her was a hooded acolyte who seemed to be in charge of the others. The acolyte began some kind of short ceremony, before looking to Viira expectantly. "Did you devise these plans?" asked Viira, showing the instructions for the strange device.\n\n"No, they come from the master." answered the acolyte.\n\n"Master?"\n\n"You think Count Ambrosius is the master of Barrad? No, the true master lies hidden from the unworthy and undiscerning. It is our purpose to serve It, for we have done so for countless generations." The acolyte lowered her head. "But we have failed. It has become angered by the greed and cruelty of the land, and unleashed the plagues that afflict Barrad. It is the cause of all our suffering.""
  barrad_second.4.a:0 "How curious."
  barrad_second.5.t:0 "Out of the Dark, Into the Night"
  barrad_second.5.d:0 ""Who is the master?" asked Viira, once again in a cellar surrounded by shadowy figures.\n\n"It is the Great Machine, and we are Its servants." The hooded acolyte looked up and raised her hooves, prompting the rest of the cultists to follow suit.\n\n"What does this machine want?" Viira's mind raced with questions. "Can I meet it?"\n\n"Only a privileged few can discern Its will, much less stand in Its presence. We are but the Outer Circle, and I have told you all that I can. If you wish to know more you must contact the Inner Circle."\n\n"I see." Viira bowed humbly.\n\n"When you are ready, seek them out." The acolyte held up a hoof. "But be prepared to prove yourself. Only those worthy are allowed to know the secrets they hold.""
  barrad_second.5.a:0 "A machine?"
  barrad_second.6.t:0 "Descent"
  barrad_second.6.d:0 "Deep into the night, Viira sat studying the codex, looking closely at its inscriptions and comparing them to every ancient script she had samples of. She sighed in frustration, yet another dead end. The runes were alien, but at the same time they seemed so familiar. There was still a missing piece to the puzzle. She needed answers, and so she took the codex and journeyed through the woods to return to the cave. At the entrance, she saw a solitary pony emerging from its depths. "What were you doing in there?" asked Viira.\n\nThe pony stopped in his tracks. "Just exploring," he answered. Viira examined him closely, there was something odd about him. He wore strangely fine clothes, and didn't seem very comfortable in the natural environment.\n\n"Anything inside?" asked Viira. The pony shook his head, agitated. "Is that so? Because I believe I've met some of your friends who would disagree." Viira took out the codex and showed it to the pony, whose eyes went wide in realisation. He became tense, silently staring at Viira. "Please, I mean you no harm. I just want to understand!" she pleaded.\n\nThe pony scrutinised her for a long moment, before sighing. "We will be in touch. If you prove your intentions, you will find your answers." He trotted off into the forest without saying another word."
  barrad_second.6.a:0 "Promising."
  barrad_second.7.t:0 "Power Play"
  barrad_second.7.d:0 "The other members of the Pentarchy gathered once again in the study of Count Ambrosius. Viira opened up the codex and placed it on the table in front of her. "We now know the meaning of these inscriptions. They are schematics for a device capable of producing vastly more energy than any existing power station," said Viira, giving her intrigued companions a conspiratorial glance. "It goes without saying that this device has enormous potential, it could give all of us the means to achieve our ultimate goals."\n\nLeopold raised his claw. "We must decode these schematics so that we can begin construction immediately. I shall begin preparation of the site: excavation will be no issue," he said, his artificial eye scanning the instructions on the table.\n\n"And I will be able to provide an ample supply of undead labour," Silver Star boasted, drawing a scoff from Leopold. "Insolence! You DOUBT my power?" Silver Star reeled, nearly falling out of his chair.\n\nAsinti interrupted, paying Silver Star no mind. "I will be happy to assist in this matter, but first I must heed the words of the ones beyond. They demand a temple, and so I must build one." He smiled serenely.\n\n"Fair enough," said Viira. "In the meantime I will attempt to track down any groups who may know more about the origin of these plans.""
  barrad_second.7.g:0 "The remnants of the Pentarchy have at last determined the meaning of the mysterious inscriptions discovered during Count Ambrosius' great hunt. They turned out to be plans for constructing a device capable of producing an enormous amount of energy. Building this device and harnessing its power has become the Pentarchy's foremost priority, and the process of fully decoding the schematics has already begun."
  barrad_second.7.a:0 "Viira takes the lead."

  barrad_second.8.t:0 "Quills and Dust"
  barrad_second.8.d:0 "    Asinti and Leopold found themselves in a library deep within Ambrosius' manor. The room was vast and cavernous, with towering shelves crammed with books and scrolls. With each flap of Leopold's wings, the air grew dustier and dustier.\n    "Could you stop that?" Asinti coughed, waving a hoof to clear the air.\n    Looking down upon the zebra on the floor Lepold flapped his wings even faster. "I don't think I can," he said, adding after a moment, "And why exactly are you so interested in the geology of these lands all of a sudden?"\n    "Do I need a reason?" Asinti replied.\n    Leopold fluffed his feathers and tried to mimic Asinti's voice, "Do I need a reason?" Then with his own voice, he added, "Everything has a reason. I, for one, want to build a mine..." His sentence was abruptly interrupted as he crashed into a bookshelf. The impact sent the griffon and several books crashing to the floor, creating a giant cloud of dust that billowed through the room.\n    Seeing this, Asinti couldn't help but laugh. "Where's the reason in hitting the shelf, then?"\n    Leopold sprang to his paws, ripping the seams of his suit in the process. "You think it's funny?" he screamed, his breath heavy. "I'll show you something funny," he added, grabbing a book from the floor and hurling it at Asinti. To his surprise, the zebra dodged it effortlessly. Enraged, Leopold began throwing every book and scroll within reach. Each one either missed or was skillfully avoided by Asinti.\n    "Wait," Asinti shouted, catching one of the flying books. "This might be what we're looking for." He examined the cover, it read 'Deep Drill Results 989' and was signed by Ambrosius himself. "Could have just looked at the covers, but at least you had some fun," he added.\n    Leopold, still breathing heavily, began to calm down. "I wasn't looking for a book, I was trying to hit you with one," he muttered.\n    "Then at least we've concluded that you're a better librarian than sportsgriff," Asinti put a small smile, opening the book.\n    Leopold felt that his talons instinctively extended. For a brief moment, he was both mentally and physically ready to cut the zebra's throat. But as quickly as the anger came, he managed to suppress it, taking a deep breath to steady himself."

barrad_third.1.t:0 "The Count's Custom"
  barrad_third.1.d:0 ""The time has come for us to address a matter of great importance." Count Ambrosius leaned forward and rummaged through the mountain of papers on his desk. Eventually, he grabbed a photograph and held it up to show Gąsienica.\n\n"This is an automobile. It is a means of transportation, but it is also common for wealthy and powerful individuals to keep them as status symbols," Ambrosius explained. "I must have one. Contact a manufacturer and entice them to come to Barrad. I will acquire one of their vehicles to style and craft into my own." He tapped his hooves together rapidly. "Oh, I can picture it now!"\n\n"Right away, sir." Gąsienica nodded, rising to leave. The Count paid him no mind, instead staying focused on scrutinising the photograph he had pulled out and mumbling about his planned modifications."
  barrad_third.1.a:0 "Make sure it can handle off-roading."
  barrad_third.2.t:0 "Curse of Prescience"
  barrad_third.2.d:0 "Gąsienica rushed through the halls of Count Ambrosius' manor, making a beeline for the throne room. Upon entering the room, he rocketed towards the lounging Count, presenting a loose collection of papers. "Sir, I have received word that a grave threat has emerged and is attacking the mountain villages!" he blurted out, before stopping to catch his breath.\n\n"Ah yes, those reports of mutant plants near the southwestern border. A truly bizarre situation." Ambrosius took the documents and leafed through them, lazily. "Many griffons down there... that's near where you grew up, isn't it?"\n\n"Yes," said Gąsienica. "Are we going to do anything to help them?" There was obvious concern in his voice.\n\n"No need to worry, I've sent a letter to the Pentarchy." Ambrosius waved a dismissive hoof. "They can handle it. Probably. Do you know how they're doing? Are they all still alive?" The Count blinked several times before shaking his head vigourously. "In any case, I have asked them to look into this matter and resolve it. They'll get around to it when they can, and then this threat will be wiped off the map!"\n\nGąsienica frowned in response."
  barrad_third.2.a:0 "That doesn't sound very promising..."
  barrad_third.22.t:0 "Gąsienica's Quest"
  barrad_third.22.d:0 "In his personal quarters, Gąsienica was drafting a letter of his own to supersede the one the Count had already sent out to the Pentarchy. It had to be done; the members of the Pentarchy had many priorities, but the safety of the mountain villagers was certainly not one of them. "It is my understanding that Count Ambrosius recently requested that you travel to the mountains in order to address reports of aggressive vegetation," Gąsienica began the letter.\n\n"Disregard those instructions, and do not concern yourself in any way with this matter. I will attend to it personally." Gąsienica's claw trembled as he thought of the hardships being endured by the border villagers. "Those griffons are my kin, and this is something I must do myself. Your faithful servant, Captain Gąsienica." Upon finishing the letter, he sighed and clasped his claws together. It was done. All that was left to do was send it out and begin his own journey into the mountains."

  barrad_third.3.t:0 "Keepers"
  barrad_third.3.d:0 "Deep in the hostile forests of Barrad, Viira entered the ancient halls of an unmarked compound. The air was damp and heavy as her guides—a pair of robed ponies—led her into a dark room deep in the bowels of the compound. She found herself surrounded by shadowed figures standing on a circular raised platform, observing her.\n\n"Wise ones, it is an honour to stand before you." Viira bowed. "I humbly ask for your aid in my research, for I have no doubt that you all are the key to securing our future." The cultists listened silently, before conferring among themselves.\n\n"You wish to know the secrets of the Inner Circle," one of the figures said. Viira couldn't tell which one. "Your reputation precedes you. But to know the nature of the gifts we protect, you first must prove your worth to us by completing the Trial.""
  barrad_third.3.a:0 "I will do what I must."
  barrad_third.4.t:0 "Rites of Passage"
  barrad_third.4.d:0 ""Outsider, to prove yourself you must first complete the Trial of the Machine." A hooded acolyte presented a burning candle to Viira. "Take this. Travel through the caves, find the sacred lantern, and then return here. If the candle goes out, you fail the Trial, and then you will be lost."\n\nViira nodded, descending down the dark cave path to begin the Trial. She navigated the treacherous path for close to an hour with only the light of the candle to guide her, before at last coming upon a conspicuous alcove containing an ornate lantern. She took the lantern, placing the candle inside it, before making the long trek back to where she had started.\n\nUpon returning, the acolyte rejoiced at the sight of her. "It is complete!" He took the lantern with great reverence. "You walked the path of ignorance, guided by the light of knowledge, and with the protection of the Great Machine, returned to us so that you may pass this knowledge on to the next generation.""
  barrad_third.4.a:0 "So ends the Trial."
  barrad_third.5.t:0 "Shadow Play"
  barrad_third.5.d:0 ""May I enter?" Viira stood before an enormous door leading below the cult's compound, protected by several guards.\n\n"No," One of the guards—a unicorn—stated flatly. "Only the most senior among us are permitted to enter the abyssal chamber." The words contained hints of an Aquileian accent.\n\n"I see." Viira studied the unicorn closely. She seemed to be in charge of all the other guards. "You're not from around here, are you?"\n\n"That is true. I was... compelled to come here and abandon my natural history studies in Aquileia." The unicorn's eyes looked past Viira for a moment. "But it is here that I found my purpose, in the service of the Great Machine."\n\n"I have come a long way from my home, as well." Viira brought a hoof to her chest. "I hope that I may also find my purpose here."\n\n"That's all well and good, but you're still not getting in." said the unicorn, unimpressed. Viira nodded and walked away.\n\n"
  barrad_third.5.a:0 "Fair enough."
  barrad_third.6.t:0 "Splinters"
  barrad_third.6.d:0 "The air was thick and heavy as Viira wandered through a cavern deep beneath the lair of the Inner Circle. Hidden behind layers of oppressive darkness, she could just barely make out a series of bizarre silhouettes filling the cavern: the Old Machines. According to the cultists, they were gifts from the Great Machine to be worshiped and cared for, although when she pressed them they confessed not to know the original purpose of these strange creations.\n\nViira got close to one and examined it using the light of her torch. The "machine" was tall and intimidating, but also unlike anything she had ever seen before. Its lines and curves were aesthetically pleasing, seeming more the work of a sculptor than a mechanist. The texture was nothing like the machines of Leopold, it did not look metallic at all. Viira reached out a hoof to feel its surface and found it not as cold as she expected. It felt rubbery, so she pushed to test its firmness. And it groaned.\n\nThis thing was... alive? The surface shifted all on its own. Viira's blood went cold. There was no doubt. These machines had been grown, not built. Now aware that she was surrounded by organic beings, Viira was overcome by a feeling of unease. She felt like she was being watched, watched by something larger and more alien than anything she had previously imagined. Most of all, she felt afraid. Viira steeled herself. Now was not the time to turn back, not when confronted by such an opportunity for discovery. She needed to push forward."

  barrad_third.61.t:0 "Intervention"
  barrad_third.61.d:0 "After a brief period of trial and error, Viira was able to successfully awaken the Old Machines using magical stimulus. The cultists were amazed and grateful to finally see the full potential of their mysterious gifts realised. Unfortunately, the machines proved too dangerous to study in much detail after being turned on. Regardless, the computational abilities of the strange constructs are now being put to use for the advancement of Barrad."

By making use of specialised equipment she was able to glance inside the strange constructs without harming them. In the end, she determined that the organic computers could not have been a natural occurrence, and must have been built by something. Additionally, the information she uncovered about their structure will be sure to advance our understanding of computing."

  barrad_third.8.d:0 "As he made the long and arduous trek over treacherous mountain paths, Gąsienica's mind was consumed by thoughts of his home. Distant memories from when he had lived there; memories of joy, innocence, and then the most intense fear. Back before he had been saved by Ambrosius... but now was not the time to dwell on that. Much more pressing was confronting the novel menace that threatened to destroy his kin.\n\nAfter emerging from a narrow pass, he at last laid eyes on his home village, only to see it besieged by an army of shambling trees. The villagers were mounting a stiff resistance, but clearly wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer. Gąsienica let loose a shout and charged towards the trees at full speed, slamming into them with all his weight and ferocity. Fighting using only his bare claws, he split trunks and ripped off branches with his incredible strength. The villagers were inspired by the show of bravery and pushed forward, cutting down the trees with their swords and axes.\n\nOne of the fighters chucked an improvised incendiary bomb into the cluster of trees, which exploded setting many ablaze. Frightened, the remaining trees ceased their attack and began to slowly retreat. "I said no fire!" a voice shouted. "Maniacs! Are you trying to burn the whole village down?" Griffons rushed to keep the flames under control, but the voice brought back memories for Gąsienica. It was a voice he had not heard in a lifetime."
  barrad_third.8.a:0 "Could it really be, after all these years?"
  barrad_third.81.t:0 "Find Your Way"
  barrad_third.81.d:0 "Gąsienica waded through the victorious militia to find an old friend from his childhood leading them. "Jánošík!" he shouted, raising his claws high. "I hope you've been staying out of trouble!" Jánošík laughed and pulled Gąsienica in for an embrace.\n\n"I try my best," Jánošík said with a grin, drawing a sceptical look from Gąsienica. "Sure, occasionally I liberate a noble passerby from their wealth, but I never keep it for myself. It all goes to the people who need it most." Jánošík had to tilt his head up to engage in the conversation, such was the degree to which Gąsienica towered over him. "Say, I remember you being big, but now you're built like a tank! What's your secret?" Gąsienica frowned, remembering the many experiments Ambrosius had performed on him to enhance his physical performance. In the awkward silence that followed, Jánošík nervously tugged at the ornate amulet around his neck.\n\n"What's that?" asked Gąsienica, noticing it for the first time. "I never pictured you being very fond of jewelry."\n\n"This? Erm... it's just a trinket. Sort of a good luck charm." Jánošík gave a sheepish smile. "Silly, I know."\n\nA sharp gust of wind blew a branch from one of the slain plants onto the ground between them. Gąsienica picked it up to give it a closer look. "That's strange. These leaves look like the kind I use to make the Count's medicine." He took one in his claw to feel its texture.\n\n"We'll have more time for botany later, but right now I think we just made them angry." Jánošík looked towards the horizon. "There will be more of those things coming soon, and we need to prepare.""

  barrad_third.82.t:0 "A Time for Heroes"
  barrad_third.82.d:0 ""Gather 'round, everyone!" Gąsienica shouted as he stood next to a pile of nondescript crates. "We're going to need all the firepower we can muster to beat back these monsters. Fortunately, I came prepared." He kicked open one of the crates to reveal its contents: dozens of shiny new magical rifles. "Grab one, and take up a defensive position around the village!" The townsfolk did as they were told, and soon formed a makeshift skirmish line facing the approaching enemy. The shambling trees were slow to advance, but were coming closer and closer by the minute.\n\nWhen they came within range, the villagers began firing, their magical projectiles proving highly effective against the plant monsters. At the same time, Gąsienica charged out ahead, using his claws to rip the trees apart with reckless abandon. Jánošík was right by his side, felling many trees with his axe.\n\nDuring the fierce fighting, Jánošík tripped and became tangled in the roots of the slain plants, and the trees around him converged to finish him off. In desperation, he ripped the amulet off his neck and held it out towards the encroaching monsters, closing his eyes in anticipation of the killing blow...\n\nBut the blow never came. Sensing the magic of the amulet, they dared not come any closer to it. As the plants remained still, shots from the villagers and Gąsienica's devastating strikes shredded them. It did not take much longer for the remaining trees to be broken. Gąsienica, Jánošík, and the entire village stood victorious."

  barrad_third.83.d:0 "After fighting off all the attacking trees, Gąsienica sat recovering with Jánošík in his home. "I think it's time you explained what's really going on with that amulet," said Gąsienica. Jánošík nodded.\n\n"In the past, you may have seen a group of robed idiots scurrying around Barrad, raving about their god, who lives somewhere underground," began Jánošík. "A merchant I know works with them, gathering magical artifacts and the like. It's all supposed to go to the cult, but sometimes they offer some of it up for sale, and this particular item caught my eye. It's said to be imbued with magic that can scare away anything born from the cult's god." He held up the amulet. "Anything that could scare a god sounded pretty interesting to me. Of course at the time I thought that was all nonsense... but maybe those cultists were on to something after all?"\n\n"You know, I've learned a bit of magic in my time around the Pentarchy." Gąsienica examined the amulet closely. "I believe we can use this artifact to cast a warding spell that will make sure those things don't come back." Jánošík was intrigued, and watched as Gąsienica channeled the item's power into a spell. He could feel the magical energy in the air, and from Gąsienica's smile he knew the spell had been a success.\n\nAfterwards, the two went off to save the other mountain villages that were threatened, defeating any plants attacking them and casting the warding spell. After all the other villages were protected, they parted ways, and Gąsienica began his long trek back to Count Ambrosius."

The ground was littered with twisted trunks and branches scarred by deep cuts and magical blasts, the bodies of trees which had only recently threatened to wipe the mountain villages off the map. Viira took a sample from one of the plants, tucking it away inside her bag, before heading towards the nearby village. As she approached the town she could sense a strange magic in the air. She questioned the villagers about the spell, and they pointed her towards the griffon who had cast it.\n\nViira tracked down the griffon, who was named Jánošík, and eagerly shook his claw. "Greetings, I am Viira." She smiled. "And I must say, superb work dealing with those nasty plants! May I ask you a few questions about how you managed it?" Jánošík clearly recognised her and scowled, remaining silent. "Now I know you may not be fond of the Pentarchy, but any information you can provide will help me get to the bottom of this matter, and ensure such a tragedy never occurs again," pled Viira.\n\nJánošík sighed, moved by her sincerity. "All right," he said, leading Viira to the location where he kept an ornate amulet. "This is it." Jánošík offered the amulet for inspection. Viira held it up and flipped through her codex, comparing the symbols inside to those adorning the artifact.\n\n"Interesting..." she marveled."

The mad Count refused to abdicate, and battle was joined. Ambrosius and his minions were no match for the combined power of the four friends, however, and they were quickly defeated. As the four became close friends, they fully realized the depths of their wrongdoing. They appeared before the commoners of Barrad and apologized for their actions, admitting that their aims were misguided.\n\nThe peasants, however, did not care. When they realized the four had let their guard down and were within reach, they immediately descended upon them to enact their vengeance for decades of horror, abuse and slavery. An angry mob of hundreds of ponies armed with pitchforks and torches swarmed the magocrats and slew them one by one before they even realized what was happening. Thus, the Pentarchy came to a violent and sudden end.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events is sure to signal the beginning of a new era for Barrad, although only time will tell if it is to be a happy one."

Profoundly unsettled, trying to converse with Viira was akin to chatting with a ravenous wolf behind its toothy grin.\n\nHowever, this sensation had recently changed. Before, Silver would've searched a way out of a situation involving Viira. He now found himself oddly at peace as the two of them shared the main table at the library, each diving deep into their tomes. The unicorn hadn't even noticed Viira, and when he did, there was no reflexive recoil nor a shudder. Instead, as Viira looked up to meet his eyes, she smiled and greeted him with a "you're looking well."\n\nPerhaps, had Silver been anypony else, Viira might have seen him as a threat that required eliminating. Together, however, she merely treated him as a partner, an ally... a friend?\n\nSilver, with a faint smile, greeted back."

Worrying over the frailty of mortality."\n\nLeopold's mechanical eye whirred as he sipped his drink, making Silver tense up slightly. "Do you fear me?" Leopold asked unexpectedly.\n\n"I- yes," Silver replied with a start, somewhat surprised at his own candidness.\n\n"And why is that?" Leopold placed his glass on the table beside him. "I've never once made an attempt on your life, have I?" At Silver's silence, the griffon added, "I've only spoken about bettering people. I've mostly referred to enhancements in strength and durability, true, but in essence, I want people to live better. And how do people who enjoy better lives fare?"\n\nSilver looked up. "They... they live longer," he answered, slowly understanding.\n\n"Exactly, Silver," Leopold said with a cackle. "Were we to work together, why, you could live forever. Wouldn't you fancy that?"\n\nSilver suddenly became very interested in what Leopold had to say."

Silver wasn't even sure why he'd come to Asinti's own abode—the mad stallion was talking to skulls!\n\nAsinti's cold eyes shifted. "What brings you here, Silver Star of Wittenland?" He spoke quietly yet with authority.\n\n"Did- did you know them?" Silver asked, trying not to imagine the corpses that the skulls once were.\n\nThe zebra rose to all four, a grimace forming on his face. "Not all of them," he admitted, "but they all deserve respect regardless."\n\nSilver had to fight against baulking at the idea of giving praise to skeletons—to death itself, but his reaction was still evident. "I know of your fears, young one." The elder zebra slowly approached the Wittenlander, and placed a hoof upon his shoulder. "I only wish to stop the institution that causes the needless pain and suffering that always ends in the deaths of innocents."\n\nThe unicorn turned to face the grinning skulls. Had he been born a zebra, how likely would it have been that his skull was part of Asinti's collection? Facing Asinti, Silver asked, "To stop their deaths and those of others?"\n\n"Wherever I am capable of doing so," he stated firmly, his grimace fading. "Why won't you help me to stop the deaths of those in suffering?"\n\nSilver mulled over his words. Perhaps he would never get over the absurdity of the skull collection. Still, he could put his unease aside to save others besides himself."

Recognizing Gąsienica, he casually tossed the vial aside and asked, "Yes? What brings you here?"\n    "It's about Asinti, Viira, Leopold, and Silver Star," Gąsienica started, getting straight to the point.\n    "Have they done something amusing?" Ambrosius asked with clear excitation in his voice.\n    "No, my lord. They have, in fact, formed an alliance and ceased their conflicts," Gąsienica reported.\n    Upon hearing it Ambrosius bursted into laughter. It echoed off the stone walls, growing in intensity until it felt like it was repleacing the air in the room. And as the sound of laughter were consuming the room, shadows on the walls began stretching and expanding until they threatened to engulf everything in darkness.\n    Gąsienica acted swiftly. He reached for his master, pulling him close with one claw while retrieving a small vial of liquid from around his neck. Without hesitation he uncorked the vial and poured its contents into Ambrosius's open mouth. Upon drinking it, his body and spirit began to calm down, and so too did the shadows retreating to their corners.\n    Once Ambrosius was steady on his hooves again, Gąsienica asked, "Should I deal with them, my lord?""

  barrad_friends.6.d:0 "    The sun was setting, creating a rare backdrop for Silver Star who usually did not get outside at this hour. However, an invite from Leopold for a card games night was enough for him to change his usual habits. Although he had always been skeptical about card games until he discovered you can play them with others. He was so distracted by strategizing about the night ahead, he nearly missed out the subtle movement in the bushes beside the road.\n    At near instant alert he turned towards the noise, ready for whatever might emerge. His readiness paid off when a hooded figure with a knife jumped out of the bushes. Silver Star had imagined this exact situation too many times and reacted quickly, sidestepping the initial attack. As the attacker spun for a second strike, aiming for Silver Star's throat, the knife met not flesh but a magical barrier.\n    "Face your end, vile beast!" Silver Star shouted, convinced about his victory.\n    However, the assassin didn't waste time with barter. When their knife got stuck in the barrier, they pulled out a strange device that began draining the magic from Silver Star's shield. Caught off guard, Silver Star felt a rush of panic. Without time to think of a new plan, he channeled all his magic into a powerful beam that fired it at the attacker, hitting them in the head.\n    After ensuring there were no more attackers hiding nearby, Silver Star took a moment to catch his breath and approached the fallen assassin. Removing the hood revealed a zebra, which left Silver Star's confused. The cloak, adorned with odd symbols that matched those found in the cave the explored and on the garments of cultists Viira had taken an interest in, raised further questions."

Usually, identifying threats was straightforward for him, like spotting a clear stream in the daylight. Now, doubting the people he had grown close to felt uncomfortable and confusing. He thought inviting everyone to his tower might shed some light on this case — if someone had ill intentions, perhaps they'd skip the meeting. But they all showed up, leaving Silver Star still clueless. He hadn't mentioned what had happened that night, still trying to figure out the best way to bring it up.\n    "Silver, are you with us?" Leopold interrupted his thoughts. "You seem troubled."\n    Caught off guard Silver Star needed an excuse. "I... I'm just sad I missed our game night," he said.\n    "What game night?" Viira looked puzzled. "Are you sure you're not mixing it up with a dream?"\n    That question sent Silver Star's mind racing. He quickly thought it might be Leopold, or it was just a coverup to trick him. "Maybe that's it. I've been having trouble sleeping," he deflected.\n    "If you're having trouble sleeping, I have a great tonic for that," Asinti offered, sounding genuinely helpful.\n    Silver Star's suspicion momentarily jumped to Asinti. Would that tonic put him eternal slumber? But then he remembered that strange device, it didn't seem like alchemy.\n    "No, it won't make you sleep forever," said old zebra.\n    A telepath! Silver Star's mind shouted, But his inner monologue was interrupted once more by Asinti, "Sadly, I can't read others' thoughts."\n    "How did you know..." Silver Star began to ask.\n    "You tend to mumble when you're lost in thought," Viira pointed out with a smile.\n    "No, I don't," Silver Star denied, genuinely surprised.\n    "Yes, you do. No one just had the heart to tell you," Leopold added.\n    Viira laughed softly, finding the entire situation amusing. "I always thought it was kind of cute."\n    Silver Star stood there, completely bewildered, not sure how to process what was happening around him.\n    "Look, my friend," Leopold tried to reassure him, but Asinti cut in with a dose of practical wisdom.\n    "Think about it. If one of us, or even better, all of us wanted to kill you, we would have done it a long time ago," the old zebra said."

  barrad_friends.11.d:0 "    The expedition made its way deep underground, navigating darkness veiling the ancient tunnels. As they delved deeper and deeper, it seemed like walls and floor they were walking on started to whisper secrets from past ages. However this relative calm soon turned into an ambush. Cultists attacked with ferocity and swiftness beyond that of mere mortal. Their moves unpredictable, appearing to be driven by power beyond comprehension. The black robes they wore fluttered around them, resembling the wings of some dark, otherworldly creatures.\n    The battle's intensity grew as the cultists, fueled by their fanatic devotion, seemed unstoppable. With eerie chants on their lips, calling upon their dark deity, drawing strength from their faith. Gąsienica and the four friends managed to break away from the ambush and press forward, leaving their soldiers behind. Soon they entered the cult's central chamber, a grand cathedral where they were met with an ominous silence. At the heart of the sanctum stood a massive gate, darker than the night sky itself. There,  Ambrosius lying unconscious on the altar. Seeing his master Gąsienica flew to assist him, but was stopped by a sudden gunshot. Turning around, he saw Leopold with a smoking gun.\n    "Sorry, big one, neither you nor he are getting out of here alive," Leopold declared.\n    Gąsienica examining his new wound said without turning to face them, "We will see"."

  barrad_friends.12.d:0 "Leopold aimed at the massive griffon. However before he could pull the trigger he found himself knocked down on the ground. In the blink of an eye, Gąsienica managed to close the gap between them and now stood above the sickly griffon, preparing to finish him off. Lying there, Leopold struggled to catch his breath and unable to reach his gun. But suddenly a thick cloud of smoke enveloped both griffons.\n    Viira, seizing the moment quickly dragged Leopold behind a large stone bench for cover. When Leopold tried to speak, she shushed him. "Hold your breath. I'll try to get Asinti here to help you," she whispered urgently, peeking over the bench. Through the clearing smoke, she saw Asinti and Gąsienica in a standoff, each waiting for the other to make the next move.\n    Driven more by instinct than by a well-thought-out strategy, Viira picked up a stone tablet from the bench and hurled it at Gąsienica, hoping to distract or, better yet, injure him. To her astonishment, he caught it mid-air and sent it flying towards Asinti with much greater speed. The tablet struck the old zebra in the head, causing him to fall to the ground.\n    As Viira tried to understand what had just happened, Gąsienica's gaze fixed on her. Seeing it she knew she had to run, though outrunning the griffon was unlikely. Preparing to flee, her mind filled with fear and desperation, she cried for a miracle to save her."

  barrad_friends.13.d:0 "Facing his worst nightmare, Silver Star was overwhelmed, but now he was also about to witness those close to him suffer a same terrible fate. As Gąsienica attacked Leopold, he was paralyzed by fear, unable to act, and instinctively sought refuge in the darkness. His whole body was frozen by the shock of the attack.\n    Lost in his fear, Silver Star hid, losing track of time in his panic. Seconds felt like hours as he tried to make sense of his thoughts, but the terror of his situation made it impossible to think clearly.\n    Then, a sharp scream snapped him out of his daze. It was Viira, trying to escape wrath of Gąsienica. Yet, what recourse did Silver Star possess, other than to flee as he had done countless times before? But in this very moment a chilling revelation crystalized within him."

She approached him slowly, subtly wiggling her eyebrows.\n    She reached out and grabbed his robe. "'It's something I should have done a long time ago," said Viira, coming face to face with him. Time seemed to slow, and sweat dripped down Silver Star's muzzle. "Goodbye." His eyes went wide, but before he had time to process what had happened, the deed was already done. Viira subtly kissed his forehead while still holding a dagger behind her back. "Be careful," she added."

  barrad_friends.15.d:0 "Viira's ears rang with a resounding slam that she thought was the end, but when she opened her eyes, there was no pain. Confused, she saw Silver Star standing before Gąsienica, trying to maintain a magical barrier between them. Fearing that any sound might break his concentration, she ran away to check on Asinti and Leopold.\n    "Are you both okay?" Viira asked as she approached, her voice full of concern.\n    Leopold, despite his injuries responded, "I've had worse." He held up a vial for Asinti. "This one?"\n    Asinti, weakly, corrected him, "Indigo, not purple."\n    Leopold finding the right potion, administered it to Asinti. "I hope this elixir has some effect," he murmured before collapsing to the ground, his eyes clouded by a haze of pain.\n    "Silver Star is fighting Gąsienica. We need to help him," Viira urged.\n    With every movement causing him pain, Leopold began to unbutton his suit. "I have a hypothesis," he said while revealing arcane machinery infused into part of his body. He began to detach part of it. "Get to him point-blank and connect these two cables," he explained while giving a magical crystal to Viira. "Don't lose it, I will die without it," he added with a heavy sigh.\n    "No! You can't risk your life like that," Viira protested.\n    "Just go and save that unicorn," he said, barely audible."

  barrad_friends.16.d:0 "The battle between Silver Star and Gąsienica raged on, their fight shaking the room with its intensity as Silver Star bravely faced Gąsienica. But each blow from the colossal griffon threatened to shatter the unicorn's defense, his hope of striking back fading like a dying ember.\n    In the midst of this chaos Viira emerged from the shadows seizing upon an opportune moment and rushed towards the griffon. Unseen by him, as he was focused on attacking the unicorn, she prepared a mysterious device Leopold gave her. Viira yelled for Silver Star to take cover, then activated the device causing a massive magical impulse that shook the room and incapacitated Gąsienica.\n    Viira quickly rushed to ensure Silver Star is alright, relieved to find him safe. Leopold and Asinti also appeared, supporting each other in standing straight. Seeing Gąsienica defeated, Leopold was started to look for the gun to finish him off.\n    Yet, as Silver Star looked at the defeated griffon crawling toward his unconscious master, a flicker of recognition danced within his mind. He heard the faint echoes of a familiar scene, the day he survived the savage Cossack raid as a mere foal. A loyal servant, who shielded him with his own body against the blades. For two harrowing days, Silver Star had lain beneath the lifeless form of his devoted servant, bearing witness to that very same look he saw in Gąsienica's eyes right now.\n    "Leave them," Silver Star commanded. Hearing Leopold's objections, Silver Star added "Let's be above this"."

The gate was covered in strange symbols that were impossible to understand and seemed to radiate a mysterious energy, drawing her closer despite herself.\n    The mysterious melody she heard was both unsettling and strangely inviting, making her come closer step by step. And as she was about to touch the black surface of the giant gate Silver Star's voice brought her back to reality.\n    "If you want to explore it we can come back later," said Silver Star. "Leopold needs us more at the moment."\n    Snapped from the trance Viira stepped away, her gaze still lingering on gate's ancient surface."

  barrad_asinti.6.d:0 "    Flickering candlelight danced on the reactor floor, with them the eerie glow from symbols carved into the floor. The air in the room was filled with various scents, but three stood out: incense, alcohol, and blood. Hooded zebras moved around, some preparing alchemical substances, others chanting ancient words. All of them shared one thing: they bled. With each movement, drops of blood fell to the floor, and Asinti watched carefully. What he was doing down there... nopony except his closest followers knew, but everycreature would be thankful to him when he was done. At least, that’s what the voice said.\n    At one moment, all the other zebras stopped. They did not need to say more – the ritual was prepared. Asinti walked to the center of the room and stood on the runes, his hooves now covered in blood. The sensation he felt at that moment was indescribable; it was as if the pure essence of magic flowed through his veins… or not even his mortal body but his spirit, his immortal soul. Many would have stood there in pure ecstasy, but Asinti began to chant, and the other zebras joined him. They moved in synchronization, as if directed by an invisible force.\n    The temperature in the room plummeted, candle lights burst into bright blue light and all scents vanished from the air. The walls of the reactor began to shake, and with each chant the fabric of reality was trembling. Suddenly, a thunderous wave knocked everyone in the room to the floor. It took a life worth of willpower to stand up, but Asinti managed to. As he looked around, searching for any sign that their efforts had yielded results. But the room was the same as before, the dim lights, the scents.\n    "I’ve failed again," Asinti whispered, dropping to his front knees. But then, almost instantly, a familiar voice echoed in his head, the voice he had hoped to hear with his ears and see with his eyes. "

But Asinti knew it’s timbre too well, something has happened. "You did very well. I'm proud of you," the words echoed through zebra’s mind.\n    "But nothing happened. You did not come," Asinti said aloud in frustration. "I must have done something wrong. There is..."\n    "Shhhh..." the voice interrupted, its tone yet again eerie whispers Asinti knew well. "You seem confused, and that might be my fault," It said. "We just eliminated our biggest obstacle, the so called god that the cultists worshipped."\n    "It was real?" Asinti asked, staring blankly into the air.\n    "Don't interrupt me," the voice continued. "You must now take over that cult and use them for our cause. When you are ready, I'll show you the ritual that you must carry out in the most sacred chambers of their grand cathedral."

  barrad_silver.22.d:0 "Truthfully, Silver Star didn't quite know what would happen after he had ascended into a Lich. When he was young, he'd read forbidden passages of powerful mages in the far north who had mastered the art of unlife. Still, those scraps of knowledge seemed to overlook something crucial: the amount a pony would have to sacrifice in order to gain immortality.\n\nSilver Star looked at his foreleg. Once vibrant in color and with neatly combed fur, it was now a shriveled, pale tan that lost patches of fur every time he brushed his hoof across it. It was... disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nHe tried to take solace in his victory over the Pentarchy, though the joy and vindication he had first felt seemed more elusive than ever. Emptiness seemed to be his primary emotion now, despite his best attempts to deny it.\n\nThe Archlich paused as he tried to focus on that phantom feeling. Perhaps... perhaps if he replicated it. If he became more powerful, if he defeated greater foes, then this emptiness might go away."

Even then, Silver felt naught but a great vacuum where once he had enjoyed speaking with the griffon.\n\nOut of desperation, or perhaps foolishness, he commanded one of his undead to attack him in hopes that he would feel fear. Still nothing, he realized, as he tossed aside the now-inert skeleton.\n\nThis was becoming a serious problem. Silver looked down at his foreleg again. Some parts of the bone were starting to show through the various tissues and ligaments, and if he looked closely enough, he could see the magic aura that allowed his body to move in undeath. He briefly wondered if becoming a lich might have been a mistake.\n\nSilver shook his head to rid himself of that notion. No, there was no mistake. He simply hasn't found what would make him truly happy, yet. He simply needed to keep looking, to keep trying...\n\nHis thoughts turned to the Kingdom of Wittenland from which he had been ostracized.

  bar_sane_ambrosius.1.d:0 "Deep beneath the surface of Barrad, Count Ambrosius stood before the reactor with Gąsienica at his side. Ambrosius was in awe of the majestic device, and ephemeral voices beckoned him to approach it, come closer... He did, shambling towards it until suddenly the voices stopped and the pain started.\n\nIt was as if an entire universe was trying to make its home inside his skull! Unable to withstand it, he keeled over, screaming in pain. He brought his hooves to his head in an attempt to keep it from bursting from all he felt inside it. Upon seeing Ambrosius' state, Gąsienica was frantic, and poured many doses of the Count's medicine into his open mouth. Was this much of the drug unsafe? Gąsienica didn't know, but he had to do something.\n\nWithin the mind of Ambrosius, he fought against the invading presence with all his will. His thoughts were chaotic and it was impossible to centre himself. All seemed to be a whirlwind of hatred and hostility, until he noticed a voice inside the cacophony that was different from the rest. He sensed this part of the presence did not wish him harm, and so he focused on it. It told him what the presence truly was, that it was the product of seven ancient unicorns who had used a primordial spell from another age to merge together into one consciousness, but now was totally dependent on magic in order to survive. It told him that they did not want to cause all this, but that Ambrosius had unleashed a power that had corrupted them. Finally, it told him that it would use the last of its uncorrupted will to free him from his madness.\n\nAmbrosius awoke to find Gąsienica beside him, grateful to see him alive. For the first time in an eternity, the fog was gone. His thoughts were finally clear. He felt like vomiting, but there wasn't time. He was responsible for an immense mistake, and there was no time to waste in putting things right. "Return to the surface, Gąsienica," said Ambrosius. "I must stay here and work on a way to fix what I have broken. Make sure things don't fall apart out there in the meantime.""

After emerging from a narrow pass, he smiled as he laid eyes on his home village at peace. The aftermath of their battle with the plants was still visible, but now the mangled monstrosities were overgrown by vegetation of a more mundane variety.\n\nAs soon as he entered the town Jánošík came out to greet him, laughing heartily. "Good to see you, friend! Come to drag us out of the fire again?" He gave Gąsienica a playful punch which had absolutely no effect.\n\n"Not this time, fortunately," said Gąsienica. "In fact, I have come to ask you for assistance. The Count is... away dealing with a matter of some importance. As you are a more respected figure than I among the mountain villages, your support would be appreciated at this time." Jánošík wore a mask of inscrutable contemplation. "Since he protected you in your time of need, it's only fair that you help him in return."\n\n"No, no." Jánošík wagged a claw. "It wasn't him that saved us, it was you. And so I will do this for you." His voice shifted to become deadly serious. "Under one condition - if we are to respect your rule, you should respect ours. Promise that our villages will retain their autonomy, and I will help." Gąsienica nodded, and the two shook claws."

  bar_sane_ambrosius.3.d:0 "Gąsienica walked cautiously down dark forest paths in search of the mysterious merchant Jánošík had dealt with in the past. It was this dealer that had provided them the artifact to ward off the corrupted plants when no other means proved effective, and any creature trading in such powerful magic was worth seeking out. Gąsienica had gone to the last place Jánošík said he met with the merchant, but saw only abandoned buildings with no civilisation in sight.\n\nHe was on the verge of giving up hope when a raspy voice slithered out from the darkness. "A visitor?" Gąsienica turned around and was surprised to find a stallion dressed in discoloured rags beckoning to him. As Gąsienica approached, the stallion gave a wide smile, revealing a glimmering gold tooth. "Come in!" He disappeared into a decrepit shack with Gąsienica following behind.\n\n"You have come a long way looking for something, haven't you?" The stallion looked over the strange items that covered the walls before rummaging through one of the many containers laying haphazardly around the shack. "How about this?" He asked, pulling out an item and tossing it to Gąsienica. "This artifact will ensure you gain the favour of the people," he explained. Gąsienica ran his claws over the teardrop shaped object and could feel the magical power within. "Use it during the wet season to increase crop yields by an enormous amount."\n\nGąsienica had found his merchant, but this was quite unexpected. "You're just... giving it to me?" he asked.\n\n"You have earned it." The merchant raised his hooves high in praise. "You have done more good for this land than you know, my griffon friend!""

They sensed an opportunity, and were simply waiting for the right time to make their move. It was clear that they were far from convinced, words alone would not be enough."

When he reached their secluded compound, he found a scene of chaos and heated arguments. No two cultists had kind things to say to one another, and the volatile atmosphere felt like it could combust into violence at any moment.\n\nIt seemed that the Pentarchy's actions had ultimately created a schism within the cult. None of the members had heard from their god in some time, and they felt the deity's influence was growing weaker by the day. Those in the cult's Inner Circle accused the Outer Circle of being faithless, while those in the Outer Circle accused the Inner Circle of becoming corrupt and rotten, prompting their god to abandon them.\n\nGąsienica sighed. He didn't have time for this."

When Gąsienica reached him, Ambrosius looked tired, having studied magical texts nearly nonstop preparing the ritual to heal the being that had driven him to madness and back. Gąsienica held his breath as Ambrosius approached the reactor to perform the ritual. When he began the ritual in earnest, power started swirling all around them until suddenly, everything stopped, and the world became still.\n\nA voice spoke to both of them, but it was not the elusive, shifting voice Ambrosius was used to hearing. It was a calm voice, low and quiet but at the same time not difficult to hear. "I am awake." The presence in the air washed over them like an ocean current. "My actions have wrought so much pain, so much destruction. For that, I can not express the magnitude of my sorrow." The room seemed to somehow fill with sadness. "But now I am freed from hunger and chaos, and I wish to do now what I have been unable to do for far too long. Let us make this world a better place."\n\nGąsienica was in shock from what he was witnessing and was completely unsure how to react. Ambrosius, however, smiled. "Yes, let's.""

He let them linger, but when silence returned as sole reply, he pressed on. "So, maybe we should start over again how the situation looks like so it might be easier to find a solution to it."\n    The room remained quiet, except for Asinti's heavy sigh. He had heard this more times than he cared to count, each repetition seemingly more fruitless than the last. Expecting the griffon to speak up any moment, he swept over the room. His gaze paused on Viira, she seemed disconnected from the what is happening around, her stare piercing through the mortal veil into some distant abyss. It was a look he knew too well—the haunting sight of someone who had faced death. His attention then shifted to Silver Star. Despite the recent chaos, the unicorn appeared outwardly calm, but Asinti could sense an inner turmoil. Whatever Silver Star was wrestling with remained a mystery for him now.\n    Leopold, not deterred by their silence, began, "Given our recent actions, we're now facing..."\n    "We get it," Asinti cut in before Leopold could outline their bleak situation again. "Ambrosius is in a coma, cultists are on the warpath, chaos reigns, and everypony is vying for power. While Gąsienica is trying to reestablish some order with the fire and sword." He locked eyes with Leopold. "Did I miss anything?"\n    "That sums it up," Leopold conceded. "Which is why I believe we should ignite the reactor. It might just give us the advantage we need." He turned to Viira, "What do you think, my deer?"\n    "I... I don't really know," Viira's response was barely audible.\n    Leopold, persistent, tried to rally support from her, his questions becoming increasingly insistent as he sought to persuade her. As Asinti began to argue with him, their voices merged into a meaningless cacophony for Viira. The world around her dimmed, memories flashing in the encroaching darkness. The rapid beating of her heart was the last tether to reality before her mind spiraled into the void. And in that moment of near dissolution, a simple feeling of warmth snapped her out of it. Opening her eyes, she found Silver Star trying to hug her.\n    "Leopold is right, we should ignite it," Silver Star suddenly declared, his confidence surprising for the rest. "But there are only four of us, which is why we need Gąsienica to return the favor. Hopefully, this settles the debate," he added. Rest of the group only looked at eachother and responded:"

Viira, feeling the tension, instinctively moved slightly behind Silver Star.\n    Seeing Viira's subtle move, Silver Star went ahead with what they had come to say. "We think we've got a way to wake up Ambrosius," he said, keeping his eyes on Gąsienica for any reaction.\n    At the mention of his lord Gąsienica flinched, most would not notice but Silver Star was very keen on seeing any kind of movement.\n    "The reactor, it has great magic potential. We believe we can use that power to heal Ambrosius," unicorn explained.\n    "What do you need me to do?" Gąsienica asked.\n    "We need some time to make this work, and we need somepo... somegriff to keep the cultists off our backs," Silver Star laid out.\n"

They might back out of our deal if they think I've been dishonest."\n    "Are you always this helpful?"

"I'm on time. They were just wrapping up their prayers. I think I've convinced all the key figures to meet," he said, walking up to Silver Star and patting him on the back. "So, you're the new ally Gąsienica mentioned? Nice to meet you."\n    Silver Star was thrown off, not just by Janosik's friendliness but also by his ridiculously large hat. Nonetheless, he replied, "Good to meet you too."\n    "Not big on talking, are you?" Janosik observed. "Are you here alone?"\n    Silver Star just nodded, slowly realizing he is going to be surrounded by the griffons and one of them nearly killed him.\n    "Don't worry, you'll be fine at the party with me. I'll make sure you don't drink too much," Janosik assured him.\n    "Party?" Silver Star was now clearly confused.\n    "Didn't Gąsienica tell you? You think we will make arrangement with someone we haven't drink with?," Janosik said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n    The giant griffon's piercing gaze became even more intense, as if that was possible.

However, this time Gąsienica and his troops were well-prepared, understanding exactly whom they were up against. With fire and gas, his forces penetrated the depths of the underground sanctuary, claiming nearly all of it under our control.\n    Meanwhile, a different drama unfolded on the surface. In a seemingly desperate maneuver, a cult's high priestesses was waiting in the shadow of night for her targets to fall asleep. She waited patiently, and at the first sign of opportunity, she entered the building through a window.\n    "Lost, are we?" a voice emerged from the darkness of the room.\n    The priestess remained silent, scanning the shadows to locate the speaker.\n    "No need to act like a foal," the voice added. Suddenly, the priestess felt movement behind her. Before she could react, someone grabbed her mane, and in one swift motion, she was thrown to the floor.\n    The sound of body slamming into the floor drew three more creatures into the room, who quickly turned on the lights."Asinti, what is going on?" Silver Star shouted.\n    "Just got us a new friend," Asinti replied, pointing at the unicorn he was holding down on the floor.\n    "And she is?" Leopold asked with sleepy voice.\n    "Gebléod, devoted servant of our lord and master," the unicorn stated in a soft voice marked by a distinct foreign accent.

With attention fixed on the enormous crystal destined to soon become hearth of the reactor, she heard a hauntingly familiar voice. Viira, Viira, Viira... It felt like the crystal itself was calling her by the name.\n    "Viira!" Asinti's voice snapped her back to reality. "Are you alright? I'm quite worried about you."\n    "No, no. I'm fine," she replied hastily, "Do you need my help with anything?"\n    "Quite the contrary," the old zebra looked at her. "Tell me, what is troubling you?"\n    "Nothing, really," Viira looked away. But even if not facing him she could still feel his gaze, there was something utterly sinister in it like he was looking thought her mind and soul. She could only withstand it for a moment. "Can I ask you something?"\n    "Of course," said Asinti.\n    "Have you ever... hurt someone you cared about?" The question lingered for a while.\n    "I have," he admitted, but it was clear the answer did not same to him easily. Old zebra's expression changed like an arrow pierced his hearth.\n    "And how did it make you feel afterward?" Viira pressed on.\n    "Horrible," he confessed after a long moment of silence. His eyes locked with Viira's, for a moment it appeared like there was a sight of regret in them. "But there was always a greater reason, and The price paid was already too high," he added.\n    "Would you do it again?" Viira inquired.\n    Asinti weighted words he was about to say. "I... I'm not sure if I have the strength anymore,"\n    Viira wanted to digest his words, but she couldn't. Overwhelmed, tears started to stream down her face, and soon, she was sobbing uncontrollably. The sound of her crying halted Leopold and Silver Star's argument, drawing their attention.\n    "Shhh... young one," Asinti said softly, hugging her. "There's no need to cry."\n    "But there is!" she cried out between sobs. "I-I-I was about to kill you all!" Her confession filled with anguish. "The reactor, the cult—it's not what you think!" Her tears flowed freely now.\n    Feeling a comforting touch on her back, and then another, Viira opened her eyes to see Silver Star and Leopold attempting to console her, their expressions a mix of concern and relief.

"But it appears to be best course of action."\n    "Please, let's think this through once more," said the griffon.\n    "We've already been over this," Silver Star responded, meticulously reviewing the sensor one last time to ensure everything was set correctly.\n    "I really hope you know what we're doing," Leopold sighed, turning his attention back to fine-tuning the equipment. Without looking away from the task at his claw, he asked, "And how are you holding up Viira?"\n    The deer, nestled in a corner of the room had been sitting awfuly quiet. The revelations she had shared with her friends about the cult, the reactor, and her initial intentions had left her in a whirlpool of emotions. She wrestled with feelings of shame, regret, anger at the missed opportunity. Yet amidst it all, she found... a relief. Despite deception and lying being her second nature, sharing the truth with her friend felt suprisingly great. The support and understanding they offered in response to her confession had been unexpected but immensely comforting. They came up with a new plan, use the reactor's power to obliterate the ancient entity, aiming to liberate Barrad from its curse once and for all.\n    "Quiet day, huh?" Leopold attempted to once again banter with Viira.\n    "I'm just worried," she admitted, her voice tinged with apprehension.\n    "A bit late for second thoughts," Asinti commented, turning towards her. "We're ready for ignition."\n    Silver Star chimed in, "Not sure about the side effects. I suppose those more sensitive to magic might experience some discomfort when we shoot this much energy at the god," he said, trying to offer a reassuring smile."

"Except of course attempt on my life." His gaze drifted to a painting on the wall, depicting himself and a mare unknown to the rest of the group. "What do you believe I should do?".\n    Silver Star tried to respond but was quickly interrupted by Ambrosius, who looked directly at him. "During my slumber, I was blessed with clarity I didn't remember I had. With it came reflection," said old pony. "I've come to realize the amount of ruin I bringed into my lands." He made a feeble attempt to adjust his position, but his body refused to cooperate. "I could try to redeem myself with my deeds, but they could suffice." He voice got heavier, "Silver Star, please come closer."\n    With hesitation, the unicorn came closer to the bed.\n    "You once showed me mercy."

Then a melody caught his attention, a piano piece so tender it momentarily swept away his concerns. Curious to discover its source, he followed the sound, hoping to distract himself from his swirling thoughts. \n    "Beautiful song," Silver Star remarked, upon finding the creature behind the music.\n    Gąsienica caught off guard, ceased playing. "Thank you, my lord," he said.\n    "I'm no lord," Silver Star corrected him. "What is this piece?

Silver Star pressed.\n    "A pony who taught me to play, and a dear friend," said Gąsienica, pausing before adding, " Better known as my former lord's wife."\n    As Silver Star approached the piano, he looked up at Gąsienica. "Don't think I ever met her," he admitted.\n    "She's long dead," Gąsienica said, staring into the distance.

They managed to unleash the waters of underground lakes into the Elis River, causing a devastating flood which affected all nearby towns and villages.\n    However, amidst this hour of trial, when many ponies lives were lost and countless more lost off what they had, a miracle happened. Before the Pentarchy or Gąsienica could organize any formal relief efforts, the common ponies took the matter in their own hoofs. They came together, raising sandbags to curb the flooding, helping to evacuate, and providing shelter to those who had lost their homes.

"I'd be lying if I said the thought of us fighting each other had never crossed my mind, but now that it's actually happening…" He was walking around, his eyes not focused on anything.\n    "Do you require any aid?" Asinti asked, concern evident in his tone. "I could prepare some potions or tonics for you."\n    "Or a gun, if you need one," Leopold chimed in.\n    "Last time that worked perfectly, didn't it?" Silver Star replied with a wry smile. "Don't worry, I can handle it on my own."\n    "We just want to make sure you're alright," Asinti said, picking up a cup. "Having some help wouldn't be considered cheating, would it?" he added, taking a sip.\n    "If there's any way we can help you beat your sister, just say the word," Leopold said, patting Silver Star on the back supportively.\n    "Again, thank you, but I don't…" Silver Star began to respond but was suddenly cut off by the loud crack of the doors swinging open. Viira burst into the room, visibly upset.\n    "What are you planning, you idiot?" she demanded.\n    "To finish my tea," Asinti responded calmly.\n    Viira hissed, "Not you!" She turned to Silver Star, her frustration palpable. "Tell me you're not going to fight your sister just to prove a point."\n    "I'm not going to fight my sister to prove a point," he repeated after her.\n    "Then what are you even planning?" Viira sighed, her anger subsiding into worry.\n    "I'm planning to duel my sister to take the crown so that we…" Silver Star started to explain, but Viira quickly interrupted him.\n    "I'm sorry, now this plan sounds so reasonable," she said sarcastically. "Remind me, how did she get her crown?"\n    "In a duel…" Silver Star replied reluctantly.\n    "And since then, how many others have challenged her to get the crown?" she pressed on.\n    "Through duels…" Silver Star acknowledged, seeing where the conversation was heading.\n    "And when was the last time you dueled someone?" she asked pointedly.\n    "I fared well against Gąsienica, and against that assassin one time…" he attempted to defend his skills.\n    "Ah yes, the giant griffon we nearly fried. And remind me, what happened to that assassin? Did you evaporate him?" Viira stepped closer.\n    "Maybe," he muttered.\n    "Still see no connections?" she pressed, standing face to face with him. "It could end the same way."\n    "My sister wouldn't…" Silver Star said with doubt in his voice.\n    "I'm talking about you," Viira was staring directly at him. "What if you…" She pulled him into a tight hug, tears welling up in her eyes. "I'm just worried that you might get hurt, or your sister—I know you'd blame yourself for it."\n    Silver Star gently patted her on the back. "

This time however, the letter was bore a name all too familiar to the queen. It signed by her brother Silver Star. He explained the current situation and recent events, mentioning something about ancient cults and powerful magic. Yet White Star more interested by the fact that a significant portion of the letter was devoted to the creatures he now calls his friends.\n\nStrange emotions overtook the queen. Her brother, lost to the world for so many years, was now safe, and according to the letter, seemed happy. Having compassion for one's own brother is natural, but what of those he has surrounded himself with? White Star was unsure if they should or could be shown any sympathy."

Respecting the need for privacy his friends quietly left the room, leaving Viira who chose to stay behind.\n    Silver Star opened the letter, initially greeted by warm, familiar words from his sister. This brought a brief smile to his face. However it quickly faltered and then disappeared as he read her words condemning the actions of his companions, accusing them of transgressions against her subjects and threatening severe repercussions\n    The letter slipped from his hooves and fell to the floor as he struggled to process his emotions. Tears began to form in Silver Star's eyes as he felt the possibility of losing his friends. Before he could realize it he was embraced by Viira, bringing his head close to her chest. After wiping tears out of his eyes he noticed that Leopold and Asinti were also standing by his side.\n    Silver Star comforted by the tangible presence of his friends felt a flicker of hope ignite within him.

Viira entered the room unexpectedly, causing some books to fall off an already crowded desk. She picked up one of the books, "Modern Theory of Nation State Relations," and read the title out loud with a hint of sarcasm. Then looked at Silver Star, curious. "What are you doing up here all by yourself?"\n    "Just... nothing," Silver Star mumbled, with embarrassed in his barely audible voice.\n    Viira looked around at the scattered books. "That's a whole lot of  nothing," she commented while handing back the book she had picked up.\n    Silver Star accepted the book and sighed as he opened it again. "I think I missed out on learning some important stuff about politics... and how to get along with others," he admitted quietly.\n    Viira laughed gently, clearly amused. "You probably want to be left alone with your books?" she said.\n    In response Silver Star only nodded in silence.\n    Ignoring his nod, Viira suggested, "How about instead we study this together?" Her tone was soft but convincing.\n    Silver Star's heart raced as he looked surprised but pleased. "I would be more than happy to," he said, his voice firmer yet excited."

  barrad_friendship_tree.22.d:0 "    Truth be told, Asinti wasn't particularly interested in cataloging all the creatures in Barrad, he mainly sought a pretext to find solitude. Or at least as much solitude as one could have in his position. Nestled deep in the Barradian countryside, only his most devoted followers dared to visit him—along with his new friends. In fact, these new relationships were precisely why Asinti found himself wrestling with his thoughts so intensely lately. Halting his life's work would be challenging for anyzebra, but for him it was particularly daunting. Not only had he sacrificed so much already, but failing to achieve his goals would mean that all his actions would be in vain.\n    "I told you, you shouldn't dwell on it," a too familiar voice interrupted his solitude. "How many times must I remind you to continue our work?" the disembodied voice persisted, urging him on. "Just think of all the good we could still achieve."\n    "And what about them?" Asinti asked aloud to the empty tent.\n    "If they stand in our way... the same as last time," the voice replied in a lower tone. "We will get rid of them."\n    "But…" Asinti's voice cracked.\n    "No buts, my dear," the voice cut him off sharply. "We can't disappoint all those who depend on us when we are this close, can we?" it added in a whisper, "especially after everything we've done."\n    "You're right…" Asinti conceded with a heavy sigh.\n    "See?" the voice perked up, sounding pleased. "Now, be a good zebra and let go of this sentimental nonsense."\n    "That's what we want," Asinti continued, half to himself, "not what I want."\n    His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by thunderous laughter that echoed so loudly it nearly drowned out his own thoughts. "And what are you going to do?" the laughter transformed back into the familiar voice. "Tell the spirit of your brother he died for nothing? Or…" the voice grew louder, more insistent. "Do you want to return to being a slave? Is that the fate you truly want for yourself and your fellow creatures, for Illi's foals?"\n    "Silence!" Asinti shouted at the empty room. "Don't speak her name."\n    "Struck a nerve?" the voice laughed mockingly. "Good, perhaps this will help you come to your senses."\n    "The sun will freeze sooner," Asinti retorted, firm in his resolve. "I want nothing more to do with you.""

  barrad_friendship_tree.23.d:0 "As Asinti walked through the small village while his follower conducted a census. There was something eerily familiar about this place but he could not point exactly what. It was reminiscent of the village they had once established in Kasa. Everything felt much simpler back then, and memories of those days stirred within him, prompting reflections on the choices he had made. What if he had taken different paths? How different might life have been?\n    "You would have ended up as just another nameless slave," a voice in his head answered.\n    Asinti determined not to engage with it, concentrated all his strength on recalling those distant memories. His effort paid off, and a serene image formed in his mind. Zebras constructing a new home, foals playing joyfully around them, and beside him… her, smiling as always. But in a blink, it all changed. The smiling face dissolved into tears, the tears turned to blood. Asinti's heart raced as he saw the zebras constructing a pyre and the foals now chanting dark spells. He knew  what would come next, but was abruptly pulled from his vision by a small, squeaky voice.\n    "I'm sorry, mister," a young filly pulled his robe, her eyes wide and fearful. "You're looking for ponies, can you help us?"\n    "What do you need, young one?" Asinti asked.\n    "I can't find my mommy and dad," the filly began to cry. "I haven't seen them since some ponies in black robes came."\n    Asinti knew all too well what the cultists did to those they took, and a dark thought crossed his mind, whispered by the persistent voice in his head. Innocent blood, so pure and precious… it holds a lot of power. He quickly shook the thought from his mind, ignoring the voice's objections.\n    "Mister…" the filly tugged at his robe again, her tears having dried. "…we can't find my friends' mommies either."\n    Old zebra looked down at the innocent face before him. It would be so easy, so quick, so satisfying... His body tingled with the temptation, one command and he could claim their souls for our cause. We both know there is only one right choice.\n    "Yes, I know," Asinti said aloud, making his decision. "Come, little one, gather your friends and I will help you look for your parents."\n    The foal's face lit up with a grateful smile. "Thank you, thank you, mister!" she exclaimed as she ran towards one of the houses to call her friends."

The sound of somepony stepping on a wooden plank made him instantly alert. But the hoofsteps were very light and careful, there was only one creature in Elysium he knew who had that kind of delicate step.\n    "Why are you here? I thought you'd have your own things to do at night," Silver Star asked, without turning to look, his attention still partly on the sky.\n    "Said the one standing on the balcony," Viira replied. Her voice coming from the room's shadows, gradually moving towards the unicorn.\n    Silver Star finally looked away from the stars to see her. "I was just enjoying the stars," he admitted with a smile.\n    "Might I admire the star as well?" Viira said, smiling back as she stepped beside him.\n    "Sure," he responded, feeling a bit lighter with her company.\n    They both turned their eyes to the night sky. But soon the chill of the night air became more noticeable. Silver Star caught up in the beauty around him hardly felt the cold. Unlike Viira who feeling the chill, moved closer to him until they were gently touching. She then rested her head on his arm, comfortable in the silence and his presence.\n    "Viira," Silver Star started quietly.\n    "Shh," she cut him off. "Let's just enjoy the view.""

We've been looking everywhere for you," he exclaimed, his voice rising with each word. "You won't believe what Asinti come up with!" He looked around, but due to the lack of response, he started approaching the bed.\n    Just then, Asinti appeared in the doorway, his expression showing that he was equally moved by their discovery. "You're still under the duvet, I see. Better get up, or our enthusiastic friend here might just drag you out," he joked.\n    Leopold, continuing with undiminished vigor, said, "It begins like most interesting story I'll ever hear, and he will not continue without you" as he turned towards the bed. "Are you there?"\n    From beneath the folds of the duvet emerged Silver Star, his mane messy and his eyes showing signs of a sleepless night. "I'm here, I'm here," he murmured, his voice heavy with fatigue.\n    Leopold, with a sympathetic smile, asked, "Rough night?" But before he could continue, something else caught his attention. A sudden movement in the duvet next to Silver Star grew into a noticeable bulge, from which Viira appeared, yawning loudly and stretching wide. It took her a moment to notice the others in the room, and upon realizing she wasn't alone, her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.\n    The room fell silent, an awkward tension hanging in the air, only to be broken by Asinti's hearty laughter.\n    "Leopold, my friend," he said with a playful tone, "I hate to break it to you, but it seems much more interesting things had happened here." He gestured towards the door with a knowing look. "Come, I heard our presence is requested somewhere else."\n    Leopold and Asinti left the room quickly, their steps fading down the hallway, leaving behind a room filled with a kind of silence only seen under a bright night sky."

"It might always seem like something is off with him, but this time it's different." As they approached the temple where Asinti had secluded himself, both Silver Star and Viira started to share his suspicions. Although the ponies and zebras they passed seemed normal, something about the place felt fundamentally wrong.\n    When they reached the temple entrance, a sudden cry for help stopped them in their tracks, a filly pleading to be lel go. Without a second thought, the trio rushed in. To their astonishment, inside the temple's main hall, a group of foals was running around, seemingly playing tag.\n    "I told you something was wrong," Leopold murmured, trying to spot their zebra friend.\n    "Looking for me?" Asinti came unexpectedly from behind them, causing Silver Star to jump.\n    "I must admit I was worried," Leopold responded, his worry now turning into apprehension.\n    See even your dear friends, think as I do. The voice whispered.\n    "Shush," Asinti muttered under his breath.\n    "Huh?" Leopold took a step back.\n    "Sorry," Asinti quickly apologized with a smile. "Why are you worried about, my friend?"\n    "Well, for one, you were..." Leopold started. "Never mind that. What's going on with all these foals? Did you open a community center or something?"\n    "You could say that," Asinti replied. This is so pathetic, you know that? The voice added, but he ignored it. "They had nowhere else to go... so I figured, why not here?"\n    The trio looked around, as confused as the moment they walked into this temple.\n    "Oh, I almost forgot, would you like something to drink?" Asinti asked with smile. "We could also plan to do something together soon. I've really started to enjoy hiking," he suggested, patting Leopold on the back. "A bit of exercise wouldn't hurt you or your wings, my friend."\n    Speechless and still processing the bizarre situation, they agreed and followed Asinti to get a drink, hoping it might help them understand their friend's mysterious behavior better."

Silver Star almost fell out of his chair when he saw him.\n    "Don't sneak up on me like that again!" he told Gąsienica audibly scared.\n    "I'll try to be louder next time, my lord," Gąsienica replied, bowing his head a little.\n    "Shouldn't you be asleep? It's really late," Silver Star said, glancing at the night sky outside.\n    "Not this week," Gąsienica answered. "What about you?"\n    Silver Star just smiled slightly. "Tonight's not a night for sleep."\n    Gąsienica looked intrigued, unusual notion for him. "Something wrong?" he asked.\n    Silver Star was hesitant at first. He usually kept his worries to himself, but he felt like he could trust Gąsienica. He pointed at an old book on his desk. "This," he said. "It's not just a book. It's full of dark magic secrets. I feel drawn to it, but..."\n    Gąsienica waited for him to continue.\n    "...I don't want to go back to who I was," Silver Star added. "I'm not sure if I have strength to  resist the temptation."\n    "You will," Gąsienica said confidently.\n    Silver Star was surprised by his assurance.\n    "I thought you were just another little pony that came here in lust of power, not holding anything dear except to himself except own ego. Wasn't wrong, weren't I?" Gąsienica explained. "But such creature doesn't risk their life for friends or show mercy for those like me."\n    "So, you think..." Silver Star began.\n    "You're stronger than you think," Gąsienica interrupted. "Strength isn't just about physical power. It's about what you do."\n    Silver Star listened, realizing the griffon might be right. He had always thought of strength in terms of magical power, but what was the use of it? Hiding away from the world? Then it hit him — he had heard these words before, from somepony very close to him, but in his pride, he had never truly listened."

To break the ice, he invited both of them for dinner to spend some time together and chat a bit—and chat they did. For the past hour, they had been talking about seemingly random topics, but for some reason, half of them were connected to Silver Star. To say he felt uncomfortable would be an understatement, the amount of things he heard about himself during this dinner was more than he had heard in his entire life combined.\n    "Is everything alright, Silver?" asked White Star. "You seem quiet even for your standards, or is it just your girlfriend being so talkative that it only seems that way?"\n    Silver Star was swirling his glass in the air, not fully focused on the conversation. "No, no, everything is fi..." Then the second part of what his sister said struck him. "She is not... I'm not... WE are not together!" His glass nearly fell to the ground, but White Star caught it just in time with her magic. After a quick reflection, he turned towards Viira to see her reaction. It was easy to guess—she was laughing.\n    "If you say so," White Star let out a small laugh. "Oh, that reminded me of a story when Silver wanted to help the maids in our castle. Want to hear it?"\n    This time, nothing could prevent the glass from shattering across the floor. "Don't," was all Silver Star could manage to say as his eyes widened. But one look towards Viira shattered his hopes of not hearing the story, as she was nodding furiously with a big grin on her face. Silver Star began to wonder if there were any closets nearby he could hide in.\n    "As a colt, Silver always tried to help everybody around, which was most admirable of him," White Star began the story. "But when it came to helping our servants or, spirits forbid, peasants... Let's just say our parents did not share his enthusiasm." She sighed audibly, "But young Silver couldn't comprehend their reasons, so he tried to think what distinguished him from a common maid at the castle. In a display of innocence, he concluded that the only difference was their uniform." Viira's grin grew even larger, while Silver Star tried to hide his face under his hooves. "So, he went to them with a request to dress him like they were dressed," White Star continued. "And, of course, they did as the son of their master told them. I remember being so mad at myself for studying in the library that whole day and not being able to join this dress-up." She laughed a bit. "Then our Silver went around helping with everything his hooves allowed. It was when I went to the kitchen to grab something to eat that I saw him. It was one of the most adorable sights I've ever seen—my little brother in a maid uniform trying to make bread dough." White Star smiled. "It took a whole week to get all that flour out of his mane. Of course, neither Mom nor Dad were happy about it. When they found out, Silver was grounded for a month or so for what they called... meddling with the lesser." She sighed again, this time with much more sadness. "I still wonder how they found a dress so small that it somewhat fit him."\n    "Aww... That's adorable," Viira said, lowering her head to match Silver Star's, which currently rested on the table hidden under his hooves. "Why haven't you told me earlier that you're such a helpful unicorn?" All she heard in response were barely audible grunts. "But if you were so eager to help, then maybe you can help me with cleaning too?" Viira's grin somehow managed to widen even more. Hearing no other response, she added, "If it will help, I can get you a dress that will fit properly this time.""

The scene replayed in his mind, waves of anomalous material cascading onto his head, moving too quickly for him to react. All he could do was watch and accept his fate... But a sharp, unpleasant sensation was pulling him out of this suspended state. Pain, again and again, until he finally snapped, "Do you need to pull it so hard?" he said, turning his head toward Viira.\n    "It's not my fault it's so tangled up," she responded, taking another stick from Silver Star's mane and tossing it aside. "Also, since when are you so sensitive?" Viira added, continuing to brush his hair.\n    "Since a ton of sticks and leaves dropped onto my head," Silver Star grumbled, turning his head to make Viira's work easier. "And then crashed into bottled 'tangling spell'. Who even thinks of crafting such a spell?"\n    Viira threw away a few more sticks. "Lucky you didn't break the bottle with the 'manual breathing spell'." Silver Star used his magic to pick up one of the many sticks lying around and poked Viira with it. She grabbed it and placed it back in his mane, next to his horn. "But thanks for coming to help me clean up this place. I really appreciate it."\n    Silver Star snapped the stick rivaling his horn in half. "I guess it's at least a different experience," he said with a heavy sigh.\n    "Hey, but at least you looked super cute in that dress… until the tangling accident. A shame I had to cut it to free you," Viira teased while still brushing his mane.\n    "You were supposed to not mention it if I came here to help you," he retorted, turning toward her.\n    "I was supposed to not mention the other thing, which I haven't until now," she said with a sly smile. "Now stop being a pouty princess and let me finish untangling your mane. Unless you want to brush it yourself?"\n    With a visible blush, Silver Star turned his head away. "When you're sleeping, I'm throwing that 'manual breathing spell' into your glass of water," he muttered.\n    "Good luck distinguishing it from another tangling spell," Viira chuckled."

  barrad_leopold.1.t:0 "Unity"
  barrad_leopold.1.d:0 "    As he stood before the pulsing reactor, Leopold's feathers bristled in anticipation. The massive device positively radiated with crackling energy just begging to be harnessed, bathing the cavernous chamber housing it. Before moving any closer, he paused to reflect upon the life that had led him to this point. Once a sickly griffon, he was now on the cusp of wielding more power than any griffon in history! It was a lifetime of struggle that required inner strength, but he had refused to accept what nature had given him.\n    Leopold approached the reactor and its power began flowing through him, a trickle at first before morphing into a deluge. It was painful, at times feeling as if his body was being ripped apart, but he persevered. At last, the process was finished and Leopold emerged a changed creature. He was now a divine fusion of griffon and machine, stronger than ever before. Leopold felt like he could take on the world by himself. He had all the power he needed to create a new future for Griffonia. A better future, free from strife. He now felt volcano of emotions pushing him to persuit it. Yes, that future was now closer than ever before..."
  barrad_leopold.1.a:0 "There is still much to be done."
  barrad_leopold.2.t:0 "Breakdown"
  barrad_leopold.2.d:0 "    After emerging from the depths, Leopold swept through Barrad with an unstoppable ferocity, greatly aided by his newly-enhanced mechanical body. Even if Count Ambrosius had been prepared enough to mount a defence, it would have been useless. As it was, both the Count and the Barradian nobility were busy wallowing in their hedonism and were blind to the ascension of Leopold. At least until he had broken down the door and Leopold was personally overseeing the termination of the Mad Count.\n    In a matter of days, thought terror he never though he was capable of inflicting, Ambrosius and his lackeys were either dead or too scared to act. Leopold was now the sole master of the nation, and he had the power to mold it however he wished. No longer would Barrad be mired in backwardness. It was the dawn of a new age."
  barrad_leopold.2.a:0 "All eyes now look to Leopold Schmeller."
  barrad_leopold.3.t:0 "Perfection"
  barrad_leopold.3.d:0 "    Leopold had a problem. Although the reactor had empowered him and made possible his enhanced form, the process remained incomplete. While most of his body now consisted of sturdy metal, some weak flesh remained. This served only as a reminder of the imperfection he had been cursed with. Fortunately, he had devised a procedure to remedy that situation.\n    As he laid down on the operating table, Leopold steeled himself for the first incision from the operating machine—another one of his creations. Once it began, the process was more painful than anything that Leopold had felt before, but he bore it all the same. It was simply the price of conquering nature. After the procedure was complete, Leopold rose from the table and flexed his mechanical claws. At last, he had done it. He was a griffon free from all mortality."
  barrad_leopold.3.a:0 "Ascension is complete."
  barrad_leopold.3.b:0 "One piece remains."
  barrad_leopold.4.t:0 "The Titan's Gift"
  barrad_leopold.4.d:0 "    Once, while mining deep into the depths of Barrad, Leopold came upon a bizarre obstacle: an enormous Titan of crystal and ore. The beast was ferocious, but ultimately proved no match for Leopold's might. Once slain, the Titan's body provided a treasure trove of enchanted materials and technology to be salvaged. Leopold is now in a position to fully augment his body with armour composed of these materials, sturdier and more durable than any other alloy in this world. He is now truly unstoppable."
  barrad_leopold.4.a:0 "Ascension is complete."
  barrad_leopold.7.t:0 "The Mechanical Soldiers"
  barrad_leopold.7.d:0 "The machines marched in perfect unity, their hoofsteps blending together into a steady pounding against the metal floor below them. Leopold watched them silently, glee filling him at the sight. They were crude, for now, but they were moving under their own power, and they would fight.\n\nMost of the clockworks were the simple model, an adequate machine at best, but one easily manufactured and replaced. Expendability was a virtue of its own after all, and these were expendable like few others.\n\nStill, he found the second generation clockworks much more appealing in so many ways. They stood taller, had stronger armor and moved faster as well as with greater precision. They were an actual threat one on one, even if not quite as deadly as he'd have wanted them to be. Naturally, the production costs skyrocketed, but that was the price of quality.\n\nThe last models though, were his pride and joy. They moved with a fluid grace that set them apart from the pure constructs, and their mechanical eyes scanned the environment, actually aware of their surroundings. They understood the world around them much better than any of the simpler clockworks, and they would be able to actively command the lesser clockworks in battle. Alas, it was a shame that he had not figured out how to make a true artificial intelligence, and that for now he had to cheat by binding a mortal soul into the machines. Then again, considering the lesser clockworks could be produced en masse, he had sacrifices to spare now."

  barrad_leopold.71.d:0 "The commander clockworks are powerful, but their relative frailty has been an issue from the beginning. Thankfully, this issue is being handled bit by bit.

  barrad_leopold.72.d:0 "The commander clockworks are powerful, but their relative frailty has been an issue from the beginning. There were opportunities to address this, but Leopold has chosen otherwise, instead focusing on the industrial side of the clockworks. Yet, even if the commanders are frail, the added industrial capacity means that they will be more easily replaced."

Viira sat before it absorbing its immense power, enhancing her seer's abilities, though she had yet to master how to fully control it.\n    "Stop hiding, I see where you will be in a moment," Viira called out without looking back. "Be a good griffon and come out, don't make this harder than it has to be." She attempted to sound nonchalant, though her mind was clouded with unsettling visions of what could happen. True to her foresight, Gąsienica walked from the corridor, half of his feathers scorched and skin burned. "I didn't think you could get any uglier, but here you are," she turned to face him. "Have you come to bow before the new goddess of these lands?" Viira teased with a grin.\n    Silence hung heavily as Gąsienica slowly advanced, clearly in pain but propelled by sheer willpower. As he drew nearer, Viira got nervous. "You can bow now," she insisted, but Gąsienica kept on walking. Each of his steps thinned the possible outcomes, converging toward the one Viira dreaded most.\n    "I said, bow," she repeated, her voice tinged with desperation as the feared scenario was unfolding. In a panic, she unleashed a powerful word of magic, under a simple command "bow" power of this singular word echoed through the room, disrupting the delicate structure of magic and making the walls shake.\n    Gąsienica halted. He wanted to go forward, but his body and mind rebelled. His neck bending involuntarily. The strength he was using to raise his head up could tear apart pony or even bear, yet despite it his beak was inching closer to the ground. "Yes, my lady," he murmured.\n    Viira, startled by the unintended strength of her spell, pondered its potential. Focusing on Gąsienica, she released another surge of magic. The griffon screamed, as he tried to keep his posture intact. "What did you call me?" she asked.\n    "My lady," he gasped between jolts of pain.\n    "That's not how I introduced myself," Viira corrected sharply.\n    "I'm sorry… My goddess," Gąsienica responded."

  #only first and last needs to be written
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_flavor1:0 "Leopold had a point, taking notes is definitely more practical. What kind of looser carry around a bulky journal all the time anyway?\n\nHopefully, I'll come across something noteworthy soon.\n\n\n\nP.S. I need to investigate anomaly that swallowed my journal."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text1:0 "The Count called us all together for another one of his ridiculous feasts, and afterwards forced us to go on a hunting expedition in the forest. Things were quite dull until we stumbled upon the schematics for a mysterious device. Asinti wanted custody of the ponies that led us to them, the fool, but I ensured that did not happen.\n\nClearly, further investigation into the origin of these schematics will be necessary. Contacting the cult that provided them would be a good place to start."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text2:0 " After questioning members of this cult, I discovered that they believe the schematics originate from the deity they worship. This calls for further questioning into the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text3:0 "The deity cultists worship, the "Great Machine". Quite curious. Contacting Inner Circle cultists will be necessary to discover more about the nature of this deity."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text4:0 "After contacting the Inner Circle cultists, I received a very strange vision, possibly from their deity. The vision seemed to indicate that it was withering away and in need of something. What kind of god needs something from mortals?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text5:0 "I have heard word that hostile plants recently attacked the mountain villages, but were ultimately defeated. It would be a good idea for me to travel there and investigate the nature of this strange occurrence."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text6:0 " I visited the mountain villages and recovered samples from the hostile plants that attacked them. While there I met an interesting griffon with a magical trinket which he used to protect the villages. I studied the trinket and the warding spell he cast, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text7:0 " Asinti was grateful enough to provide me with samples of living rock he stumbled upon while constructing his absurd temple. This rock seems to have a will of its own. Quite bizarre..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text8:0 "I feel more confident in making a link between the living rock and the hostile plants. The two are connected, but what power could be behind the corruption of the very earth? I am at a loss."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text9:0 "Perhaps the answers I seek lie beneath the ground? I hear Leopold is conducting quite the excavation..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text10:0 "The Titan of living rock uncovered by Leopold's excavation was obviously a magical construct, but creating it would be well beyond the ability of any living mage. It must have been the same power behind Asinti's living rock and the plants that attacked the mountain villages. It's all connected, I know it, but how? I just need to find one more missing piece... Silver Star's library is the only place in Barrad that might contain answers, but I doubt he would ever let me peruse it voluntarily."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text11:0 "Everything now seems much more clear, the time draws near..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text_friendship:0 "Lately, I've been experiencing strange feelings. Those individuals I've been spending time with... I've become quite attached to them. Is it possible that I've started to care about them?\n\No, I can't let these feelings distract me. I must remain committed to my true path."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text12:0 "So it is done. What was once a god now lies under my hoof as a slave, with me ascending to its former position. It's unfortunate that others couldn't accept it.\n\nYet despite the vast powers I've acquired, there remain places beyond my grasp, such as mind  of the cultist's god. Perhaps, by constructing additional reactors, I might find a way to access it?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text13:0 "Yes, yes, yes! I can sense an even greater power flowing through my flesh. It's an exhilarating sensation! Even surpassing the joy I get from sensing ancient entity's fear.\n\nIt's time to teach it that no secrets can be kept from me."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text14:0 "Most fascinating, the entity comprises seven distinct consciousnesses. Yet, these separate entities come together to form a single, unified mind. What a remarkable phenomenon.\n\nThe one I succeeded in accessing revealed to me visions of cities gleaming with gold and rivers flowing with milk and honey. It became apparent that these were not just visions but manifestations of its desires and envy.\n\nCould such promises help me draw more followers while I'll be acquiring power?"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text15:0 "Accessing the second consciousness proved to be a more challenging task. It contained vast knowledge but was fiercely protected by a level of greed surpassing that of any griffon or dragon.\n\nDespite the obstacles, it now lies exposed before me, akin to an open book, and I intend to explore its contents thoroughly."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text16:0 "The only word that aptly describes this consciousness is wrath, starkly different from the others. I wonder, has it always been driven by a desire for pain and destruction? Or did it, at some point, become aware of its own potential?\n\nMuch like I have now..."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text17:0 "I once believed I understood what of joy and pleasure is, but I was mistaken. The third consciousness inundated me with visions of pure ecstasy, igniting a lust for more.\n\nHowever, I saw through its allure. As tempting as it is to indulge in such pleasures, this experience showed me the importance of not succumbing too easily to the desires of the flesh, reminding me to maintain clarity of thought."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text18:0 "This consciousness exhibits significant diligence and takes pride in its accomplishments. While it's somewhat boring, there's value in self-praise. Fortunately, I can leave the hard work part to others."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text19:0 "It's surprising how creature so powerful can become so indifferent and apathetic.\n\nI must ensure that neither I nor my followers ever find ourselves in a similar condition."
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text20:0 "This consciousness would explain  Ambrosius' actions, dominated by hedonistic desires and an insatiable appetite for magic. It's unfortunate it never found a way to quench its thirst for power like I did.\n\nIt makes me wonder if I could use my abilities in reverse to create physical objects on a large scale.\n\nP.S. There has to bo something more I can put into my hooves!"
  bar_pen_viira_clues_text21:0 "I barely feel my own flesh anymore, but there is no turning back. I must venture further, even if it means leaving the mortal realm."
